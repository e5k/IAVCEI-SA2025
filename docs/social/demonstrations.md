# Enhancing volcanoes understanding: science demonstrations to communicate knowledge with the public

Science communication is more than just outreach — it's a **dynamic bridge** between volcanologists and the public. These demonstrations associated with [Session 7.4](../sessions/session-7-4.md) embrace **interactive learning**, **multilingual engagement**, and **hands-on discovery** to connect science with society. Demonstrations are designed for a general audience from 6 years old!
