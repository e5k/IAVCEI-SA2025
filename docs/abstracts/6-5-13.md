:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

In the summer of 2024, Stromboli volcano exhibited a significant effusive activity, starting on the 4th of July with lava flows from eruptive fissures that opened in the upper Sciara del Fuoco slope. The activity culminated in a paroxysmal event on the 11th of July, producing a 5 km-high eruptive column and pyroclastic density currents flowing along the Sciara del Fuoco. In such a scenario, the emplacement mechanisms and inundation capability of erupted lavas are primarily modulated by topography, effusion rate, and rheology of lava, all parameters changing dynamically during the eruption. Accordingly, the effusive activity and the related morphological changes were closely monitored with repeated Unoccupied Aircraft System (UAS) surveys. The combination of UAS data (e.g., digital elevation model, effusion rate) with the petrological and rheological characterization of volcanic products (e.g., initial crystal cargo, crystallization sequence, viscosity) provided a unique opportunity to develop a multidisciplinary approach for the detailed characterization of both the erupted magma and the volcanic activity during an effusive eruptive event. The integration of this multidisciplinary data set allowed us to model lava flow emplacement and provide inundation scenarios, to benchmark their reliability and optimise the accuracy of numerical modelling results. The final objective is to establish a rigorous protocol for assessing the risk of lava flow invasion and its associated hazards through an interdisciplinary monitoring framework, applicable during future volcanic crises.
