The reactivation of volcanism on the Reykjanes peninsula in Iceland incited extensive faulting in urban areas and eruption of lava flows, both affecting critical infrastructure and civilians. This has called for effective monitoring of a large area (>300 km^2^) by the civil protection and geotechnicians. The Natural Science Institute of Iceland conducts routine airborne photogrammetric surveys from a crewed aircraft with a compact aerial system comprising a medium format camera and thermal camera, which allows for rapid installation of the system and rapid mobilization to the affected areas, and the collection of high-resolution nadir (10 to 30 cm) and thermal imagery (1 to 3 m) at elevations of up to 10,000 ft. This method has the advantage of minimizing time of exposure of the surveys at the volcanic areas, and the flights can be executed within one hour, under moderate weather conditions and/or with cloud coverage over 2,500 ft. The data is processed shortly after acquisition, and the results often submitted to government authorities within 5-6 hours. The products range from orthomosaics, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), maps of elevation changes, maps of horizontal deformations from pixel offset tracking, and maps of thermal images. These allow for mapping the entire lava fields; mapping the progression of the lava flows; quantifying volume, volume-changes and effusion rates; documenting vent migration; spotting active areas and inflating areas within the lava fields; identifying tectonic fractures and quantifying horizontal and vertical land movements; this data of great value for an integrated assessment of the volcanic unrest.
