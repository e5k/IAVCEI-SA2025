Since 2005 Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc), Italy, is experiencing a new unrest episode, characterized by ground uplift rates exceeding 10 cm/yr, relevant seismicity and increased gas fluxes at Solfatara-Pisciarelli fumaroles. Geodetic, seismic and geochemical data point to an inflating source located at about 4 km depth, thought to be fed by hydrothermal fluids and/or magma originating from a deeper reservoir. Recent investigations on the nature of the source of the unrest (e.g., hydrothermal and/or magmatic) are mainly based on seismic tomography and joint ground deformation and petrological modelling, while gravity data, crucial to discriminate mass and density, have not been employed up to now. In this contribution we analyze the gravity changes occurred at the CFc in the last 10 years. In particular, we show the results from numerical modelling to obtain estimates on both mass and density variations at the source. From this analysis we suggest that a hybrid source, composed by a mixture of magma and fluids, is presently driving the unrest.
