:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Forecasting changes in volcano activity requires a detailed understanding of magma plumbing architecture and dynamics in terms of geometry, distribution and connectivity of the magma bodies and magma properties. The PGF's multidisciplinary approach, we have adopted over years combines the petrological study of erupted products with the geochemical monitoring of gas emissions. This framework permits to constrain magma evolution and dynamics within a plumbing system over a very large range of pressure, temperature and compositions, time scales and frequencies of eruptive events. Here we review the most recent results obtained on two active volcanic systems (Piton de la Fournaise and Mayotte), formed in distinct geodynamic settings and with very contrasting eruption rates, volumes, and dynamics, but sharing a common feature: an important lateral shift of the deep plumbing with respect to the eruptive sites and the coexistence of both evolved (phonolite to trachyte) and mafic (basalts to basanite) melts over a large depth range. We show that the most effective monitoring is obtained by focusing on the deepest parts of the plumbing system that allow recognizing new magma recharges and lateral drainage. The occurrence already in the mantle and close to the Moho of variably evolved and degassed melts, besides primitive and volatile rich ones need to be carefully considered, in order to provide a robust interpretation of petrological and geochemical datasets. In this frame, the continuous flushing of the whole plumbing system by CO~2~-rich fluids plays a major role on melt evolution, storage, transfer and ultimately eruption.
