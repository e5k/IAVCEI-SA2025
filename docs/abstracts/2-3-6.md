Imaging localized and/or slow (< a few cm/year) deformation processes can be challenging using regular Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) datasets with relatively low spatial (> 10 meters) and temporal (> 12 days) resolutions. These limitations can be overcome by using InSAR time series approaches and higher spatial resolutions SAR sensors such as the COSMO‐SkyMed satellites constellation. Here, we show two case studies in which we processed hundreds of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired by Sentinel‐1 and COSMO‐SkyMed to reveal: 1/ a decade of ground deformation for a ∼0.5 km diameter area around the summit crater of the only active carbonatitic volcano on Earth: Ol Doinyo Lengai in Tanzania; and 2/ long-term decadal flank motion prior to the 2018 catastrophic collapse at Anak Krakatau, Indonesia.
