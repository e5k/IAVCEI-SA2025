:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Earth Sciences often receive less attention than other basic sciences, particularly among teenagers. This issue is more pronounced in countries where primary and especially secondary education systems prioritize other science subjects over Earth Sciences. Early childhood interests shape future curiosity, and fostering enthusiasm for understanding our planet and environment during formative years is critical. To address this, developing engaging educational tools has become a pressing challenge.
Comics, graphic novels, and illustrated books are increasingly effective in introducing scientific concepts to children and teens. One such resource is "**The Volkis: A Volcanic Adventure**", a creative tool designed to teach young audiences about volcanoes, their workings, and their societal impacts and benefits. The story follows the Volkis, a secret club of volcano enthusiasts, led by Rocky, the group's experienced mentor. Through their adventures, readers explore key aspects of volcanology.
The book is filled with engaging sections and characters representing volcanic products, guiding readers and educators through an exciting journey into volcanology. It is available for free and supported by a website (https://descubrelosvolcanes.es) offering additional materials like videos, experiments, and coloring pages. The ultimate goal is to make science education entertaining, accessible, and interactive, fostering learning not only for children but also for the adults accompanying them, breaking traditional paradigms of teaching science.
This geo-educational tool offers even greater potential by expanding to new adventures exploring the volcanic heritage of regions like the Canary Islands---highlighting La Palma and the 2021 Tajogaite eruption---and the Catalan Volcanic Zone.
