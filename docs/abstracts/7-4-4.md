Aotearoa-New Zealand's nearshore volcanic islands pose a threat to our communities with the potential for impacting more than 1.5 million individuals, as well as our economy, through both volcanic and non-volcanic hazards including ash fall, pyroclastic flows and tsunami. The Beneath the Waves research program aims to improve our understanding of the island volcanoes of Whakaari and Tūhua. We take a multi-disciplinary approach to exploring the anatomy of the volcanoes, simulating the physical processes and potential impact, determining potential consequences for communities and examining how to integrate results into forecasts, alerts and preparedness. To ensure the maximum uptake of the science, the program is linked with diverse end-users creating pathways for relevance, including Indigenous Māori, councils, emergency management partners and industry users, as well as existing research outreach agencies.
Engaging with our science-impact partners, for example Civil Defence Emergency Management agencies in regions with potential impacts from Whakaari and Tūhua, provides an opportunity to tailor information about these volcanoes into products that are useful and usable, increasing the feasibility that they can be used to support science-informed decision-making at all levels. We utilise several user-centred design methods including the collaborative approach of participatory design and will share our current progress on some key products. By involving the users in the design process we seek to create user-centric communication products, including dynamic digital products (e.g. ArcGIS StoryMaps) and approachable science fact sheets, that are designed with purpose, are engaging, clear and promote the connection of communities with the natural environment.
