At the moment when oil revenues continuously decrease for Algeria, developing a diversified energy matrix is an urgent need for the country. That energy matrix should be able to maintain satisfactory economic growth and cope with increased energy demand. In this perspective, Algeria has focused the attention on the so-called critical minerals, among which lithium, cobalt, nickel, platinum, copper, and some rare earths can be pointed out. These are the minerals required in renewable technologies manufacturing: solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage systems are very important for transitioning into a renewable energy economy.
This paper reviews the state of current exploration and mining activities of such mineral resources in Algeria, based on geological and morphogenetic processes that support their formation. Additionally, it analyzes the existing policies and regulations that control mining and mineral resource management, with a view to identifying how such frameworks can help renewable energy initiatives of the nation.
Targeted investments in supply chains of critical minerals could increase economic resilience for Algeria while at the same time fast-tracking its efforts towards renewable energy targets. The report calls for mineral resource management policies to be included in the overall energy transition plan of Algeria, whose ambition is to exceed 30% by 2030 concerning the share of renewable energy.
This paper brings out the need to adopt an integrated, sustained approach to exploration and development of minerals. Mineral resource management in harmony with national energy strategies will, therefore, enable Algeria to transition seamlessly from hydrocarbons into renewables throughout the next decade while ensuring environmental sustainability besides economic stability and growth. It recommends proactive policy suggestions aimed at fostering coordination among government agencies, the private sector players, and international partners to handle these high ambitions.
