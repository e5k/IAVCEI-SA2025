:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Geysers serve as natural laboratories for studying dynamics analogous to those observed during volcanic eruptions, offering a safe and accessible environment for investigation. During multiple field campaigns, we recorded acoustic and electric signals generated by the eruptions of Strokkur Geyser, Iceland, complemented by high-resolution video observations. Acoustic signals have historically been used to infer eruption dynamics, and in this study, we extend this approach to incorporate simultaneous electrical signal measurements. A typical eruptive sequence at Strokkur begins with a water bulge driven by bubble clusters that displace the overlying water, producing characteristic low frequency acoustic (infrasound) signals. These M-shaped signals are generated by the displaced volume as the bulge grows as well as the disintegration after rupture. With the onset of the rupture, higher-frequency acoustic signals (>10 Hz) and electrical signals emerge, peaking during the brief fountaining phase, which lasts approximately 1.5 seconds. Notably, the electric signals exhibit a distinctive, self-similar N-shaped waveform across events. Here we use high-speed video analysis to quantify the velocity, acceleration, and height of the leading edge of the water fountain, providing a detailed connection between fountain dynamics and the observed acoustic and electrical signals. Our analysis has already established that the bulge growth at Strokkur Geyser and its associated acoustic signals resemble those observed during Strombolian eruptions, such as at Erebus Volcano in Antarctica. This promising result sets the stage for further exploration, as we aim to identify similar connections when analyzing the detailed dynamics of the fountain itself.
