The Hoggar Mountains, located in central Algeria, represent a significant geological and volcanic region characterized by complex processes that have shaped its landscape over millions of years. This abstract explores the volcanic evolution and activity in the Hoggar, particularly focusing on Cenozoic processes which began approximately 35 million years ago and continue to the present. The region is marked by a series of volcanic events that have resulted in diverse geological features, including extensive basaltic lava flows, trachyte domes, and phonolite formations.The initial phase of volcanic activity involved the eruption of thick basaltic flows, creating a plateau that laid the foundation for subsequent volcanic development. This was followed by the formation of numerous small stratovolcanoes and various volcanic structures, including maars and cones, indicating interactions between erupting magmas and local aquifers. Notably, the Atakor volcanic field within the Hoggar showcases about 450 individual vents and significant stratigraphic variations that reflect a rich volcanic history.Geological studies reveal that the Hoggar region sits atop a domal uplift associated with ancient tectonic movements. The interplay between tectonics and volcanism has led to the erosion of older formations, contributing to the current rugged topography. The presence of ancient rocks from the Tuareg shield highlights the region's geological significance as it has been shaped by both volcanic activity and metamorphic processes over billions of years.
