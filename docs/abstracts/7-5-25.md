:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

We are developing a sustainable information framework to address the lack of standardized, machine-readable, FAIR-compliant data within the global tephra research community. The Tephra Information Portal (TIP) is envisioned as a central point of access to data resources for the community of researchers who study tephra or need access to tephra data. The TIP is a collaboration between the tephra community and the IEDA2 (EarthChem, SESAR) data facility as part of the prototyping of the Framework for FAIR Data Communities (FFDC).  We are building on existing cyberinfrastructure at IEDA2 and other tephra resources and data, including StraboSpot, GeoDIVA, TephraBase, and others. Objectives include: (a) helping researchers select a data repository; (b) ensuring consistent formats with rich metadata; (c) creating a central catalog with a compiled critical mass of curated data; (d) serving as a single point of data discovery, access, and use; (e) providing protected workspaces with user authentication and management; (f) incorporating discipline-specific standards; (g) supporting a next-generation toolkit and access mechanisms; and (h) responding to community needs.
As a first step in this newly funded project, we held a 3-day workshop (November 2024) to bring together tephra researchers, database developers and software engineers to begin envisioning the TIP and establishing collaborations with existing tephra data resources. This project leverages a decade of international tephra community building and consensus development and a strong track record of engagement to prototype and test cyberinfrastructure, produce training materials, educate users, and increase the accessibility of research tools and data.
