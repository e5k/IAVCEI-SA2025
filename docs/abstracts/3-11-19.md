The Tyrrhenian margin of Italy is the site since the Quaternary of intense K-alkaline magmatism. Several intermediate to large volume caldera-forming eruptions have occurred from nine caldera systems. The Sabatini Volcanic District hosts two calderas, the Bracciano and the Sacrofano calderas, which generated large ignimbrites. The largest of these eruptions issued from the Bracciano caldera and emplaced the Tufo Rosso a Scorie Nere ignimbrite (RNR), dated ca. 452 ka and associated with the first caldera-forming event of the district. The new geological mapping of the RNR ignimbrite allows us to quantify the erupted bulk volume calculated at 223 km^3^ (138 km^3^ DRE), which makes this a VEI6 eruption and the second of the Roman Magmatic Province after the 600 km^3^(265 km^3^ DRE) of the 39 ka Campanian Ignimbrite from Campi Flegrei caldera. Geochemical characterization of the glass allows us to test the efficiency of the residual glass geobarometry analysis with rhyolite-MELTs, and discuss the geometry and structure of the plumbing system leading to the RNR caldera-forming event.
