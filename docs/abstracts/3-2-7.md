Numerical modeling of volcanic processes in three dimensions (3D) presents significant challenges due to the complexity of the phenomena involved. The ascent of magma within volcanic conduits is influenced by several factors, including conduit geometry, magma rheology, and the interactions between physical and chemical processes. Understanding these is crucial for predicting volcanic eruption behavior and mitigating associated risks.
This study introduces, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive 3D finite element method (FEM) models for magma ascent in volcanic conduits, developed using COMSOL Multiphysics software. We explore different conduit geometries (circular, elliptical and mixed) and integrate fluid dynamics with thermodynamics for effusive eruptions, and fluid dynamics with elastodynamics for explosive eruptions. The interaction between bubbles, crystals, and magma viscosity is also analyzed, providing insight into the complex dynamics of volcanic flows.
Preliminary results show that conduit geometry significantly impacts eruptive behavior. Elliptical and mixed conduits exhibit greater variability in mass eruption rate and fragmentation levels compared to circular ones. For effusive eruptions, the coupling between fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, driven by viscous dissipation, plays a crucial role in magma flow dynamics. In explosive eruptions, the coupling between fluid dynamics and the elastodynamics of surrounding rocks shows minimal influence on magma flow, which remains primarily controlled by magma viscosity.
This methodology is applied to the Pomici di Avellino eruption of Somma-Vesuvius, focusing on the magmatic Plinian phase (EU2-EU3). The study highlights the importance of 3D modeling in enhancing the understanding of volcanic processes and improving eruption prediction and risk mitigation strategies.
