The Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program (GVP) in partnership with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) launched a new outreach project in August 2024 called the "Student Volcano Art Gallery". This project aims to raise volcano awareness among younger students and promote interest and curiosity about volcanoes, show the intersection of the arts and sciences, and encourage students to learn more using the GVP website. Students across the United States between the ages of 5-18 were encouraged to submit an original art piece using any medium (except video) that depicted a volcano or a volcanic eruption within the theme of "Volcanoes Around the World". The call for submissions was made on 15 August 2024 and was promoted through personal communications and broadly advertised on various platforms, including on social media (X and Facebook), the Volcano Listserv at Arizona State University, and Smithsonian online newsletters. The timing of this project was considered based on the beginning of the academic year for most US schools. Students submitted pieces depicting lava flows, subduction, and ash plumes, sometimes including themselves and family members. A select number of pieces were published on the GVP website in a Photo Gallery devoted to the students' art, with submissions divided into four age-group categories. This program will continue in future years, and we hope to expand the participation to international students.
