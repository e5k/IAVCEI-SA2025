:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The Roccamonfina volcanic complex (RVC), located in southern Italy, is a Middle to Upper Pleistocene stratovolcano that shares temporal and morphological traits with Somma--Vesuvius and Colli Albani volcanoes, both of which pose significant volcanic hazards to the cities of Naples and Rome, respectively. Therefore, understanding the RVC evolution may add essential features to refine the knowledge of its eruptive history and relationship with surrounding active systems.
The RVC has been active between 630 and 55 ky, producing approximately 80 km³ (DRE) of K-alkaline magma. The volcanic sequence alternates effusive and explosive episodes (with nested caldera formations) and more recent intra-caldera eruptions. Three main periods can be defined: i) the early formation and gravitational collapse of the stratovolcano; ii) the post-collapse and caldera forming period with two main caldera-forming phases which emplaced a succession of ignimbrites grouped in the Brown Leucitic Tuffs (BLT; 385-350 ky) and in the White Trachytic Tuffs (WTT; 322-305 ky); iii) a post-caldera period.
This study, conducted in the frame of the CARG project for the geological mapping of Italy, provides preliminary results of a revised stratigraphy for the Roccamonfina volcanic sequence, highlighting new insights, especially in the pre-BLT stratigraphy. The collected data include new fieldwork observations and new geochemical and radiometric measurements obtained while preparing the two geological maps named Sessa Aurunca (sheet 416) and Teano (sheet 417).
