The Volcanic Hazards Information System is developed for (1) real-time hazard assessment using online numerical simulations, (2) eruption parameter analysis at various volcanoes, (3) digitization of tephra fall, PDC, and debris avalanche distributions, (4) online tephra fall volume estimation, and (5) display volcanic crater distributions. The Volcanic Hazards Information System allows it to execute Energy Cone, Titan2D, and Tephra 2 numerical simulations on Quaternary volcanoes worldwide using ASTER GDEM and GSI 10 m DEM. Therefore, quasi-real-time volcanic hazard assessment is possible using a more rapid display and comparison with previous eruption cases. The examples of eruption parameters are essential for numerical simulations even after eruption initiation to determine the appropriate parameters, hazards and risk assessment, and future prediction of eruption scenarios. Currently, 313 cases, in total, are analyzed on the system (as of Dec. 2024). The API function using WMS (web mapping service) provides all simulation results and allows them to be displayed on various servers, GIS software (e.g., QGIS), and Google Maps. The online tephra fall volume estimation system (WebTephraCalc) was developed using segment integration, exponential, power law, and Weibull methods. The areas of each contour are calculated, and the volume of each segment is estimated on the system. Volcanic Hazards Information System is expected to be used by many stakeholders, such as researchers, students, consultants, local government staff, and Geopark staff members for geological hazard assessments, revision of disaster prevention maps, and education purposes.
