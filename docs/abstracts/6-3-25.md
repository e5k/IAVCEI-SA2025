:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The eruption of the Tajogaite volcano in 2021, Cumbre Vieja (La Palma, Canary Islands) is the eruption with the greatest impact on urban areas in Europe during the last 75 years. Once the eruption was over, the main volcanic risk that has been present until now is the anomalous emission of CO~2~ affecting the inhabited areas of Puerto Naos and La Bombilla, both 6km from eruptive vents. The first records of high levels of open-air CO~2~ concentration in these areas were measured by INVOLCAN approximately three weeks before the end of the Tajogaite eruption (December 13, 2021). To investigate this volcanic hazard, regular studies of diffuse CO~2~ emission have been conducted at La Bombilla, whereas outdoor and indoor air CO~2~ concentration have been monitored regularly at La Bombilla and Puerto Naos since December 2021. Diffuse CO~2~ emissions at La Bombilla have shown values from 4.0 to 170 td^-1^ (average=14.4 td^-1^) with δ^13^C-CO~2~ values ranging from -8.63 to -4.28‰ vs. VPDB (average=-5.5‰). Temporal evolution of diffuse CO~2~ emission rate showed maximum value during first study (170 t d^-1^), with rest ranging from 4.0 to 70 td^-1^. CO~2~ concentration in outside air measured at a height of 15cm at La Bombilla and Puerto Naos showed values up to 87% (average=0.67%) and 30% (average=0.23%), respectively, the highest recorded so far during the post-eruptive period. Both inhabited areas must be continuously monitored to reduce the risk associated with gas emissions, and innovative decisions are currently being considered to mitigate the danger associated with CO~2~.
