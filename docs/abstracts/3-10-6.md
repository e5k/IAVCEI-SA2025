Understanding pre-eruptive magma storage depth(s) is essential for the reliable interpretation of monitoring data at active volcanoes. While geophysical datasets provide important information about the current state of a volcanic system, petrological studies of historic eruptions are essential for determining variability in pre-eruptive conditions beneath long-lived centres. However, as petrological methods rely on pressure-dependent phase equilibria, they provide an inherently one-dimensional insight into magma accumulation depths with no lateral information. Such lateral information may be particularly important in large caldera systems such as Campi Flegrei (Naples, Italy) where recent (<15 kyr) eruptions have been dispersed across a large area, with vents located in diverse volcano-tectonic settings.
Here, we present an overview of historic petrological and geophysical constraints on magma storage conditions at Campi Flegrei which reveal a complex multi-level magmatic system. We then use a novel machine learning-based clinopyroxene thermobarometric model to systematically supplement these with new high precision crystallisation depth estimates for post-15 kyr magmas erupted at vents across the caldera. By comparing the crystallisation depths of magmas erupted in different spatial locations, we identify lateral variations in magma storage conditions, gaining a three-dimensional picture of the sub-volcanic architecture which agrees with independent geophysical constraints. Importantly, our results show a difference in magma storage depths which correlates with volcano-tectonic setting, indicating a regional structural control on magma storage and evolution. Our results are important for volcano monitoring, suggesting that pre-eruptive activity in different parts of large volcanic systems might be characterised by distinct signs of unrest.
