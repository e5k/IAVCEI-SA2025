Among the secondary hazards generated by eruptive events, gravity-induced flows (GIF) are particularly significant due to their rapid onset and destructive potential. Such phenomena, were observed during the 3^rd^ July 2019 paroxysm at Stromboli Island (Aeolian archipelago, Italy). One of the two GIF affected the island western flank involving the summit hiking path. To reproduce such flow, a new procedure that generates Digital Surface Model by using NASA's Ames Stereo Pipeline platform and models the flow dynamics was developed.  First results were obtained by using numerical codes based on rheology models that allow to represent the flow behavior. Here this approach provides new insights into the volcanic hazard assessment.
