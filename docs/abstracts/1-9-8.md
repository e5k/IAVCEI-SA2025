:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Thermal history of magma strongly affects crystallization behaviour, which, in turn, influences magma rheology and ultimately magma ascent dynamics. This study combines novel 4D (3D space+time) in-situ crystallisation experiments with ex-situ experiments to provide further insights into how different temperature profiles affect nucleation and crystallization kinetics in a tephritic magma composition from the 2021 Tajogaite eruption (La Palma, Spain). Using in-situ synchrotron X-ray microtomography, we directly observed and quantified the dynamic process of crystallization in real-time, capturing unprecedented detail on the interplay between superheating (i.e. temperatures exceeding the liquidus temperature of its most refractory mineral phase) and nucleation.
Experiments were conducted under two thermodynamic conditions: (1) in-situ synchrotron X-ray microtomography at 20 MPa without superheating and (2) ex-situ crystallization at 275 MPa after superheating (88 °C above T~liquidus~). The timing of clinopyroxene nucleation differed markedly between the two experimental conditions, with nucleation initiating within 20 minutes in the in-situ experiments but delayed by 8 hours in the ex-situ setup. This difference arises from the resorption of pre-existing nuclei during prolonged exposure to superliquidus temperatures (1200 °C) in the ex-situ experiments. The experimental results suggest two alternative crystallization behaviours: (i) without superheating rapid crystallization is promoted due to minimal nucleation delay (in terms of minutes), and (ii) with superheating crystal nucleation is delayed for several hours. These distinct crystallization behaviours critically impact magma rheology, influencing processes like degassing, fragmentation, and eruption dynamics. This study underscores the pivotal role of superheating in crystallization kinetics and its implications for volcanic hazard assessment.
