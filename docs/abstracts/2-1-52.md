:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Strombolian activity often occurs from adjacent vents, providing a good opportunity for understanding shallow conduit processes. In October 2023, Strombolian activity at Stromboli was occurring from three vents, with one displaying ash-rich explosions (S vent) and two others (N1_1 and N1_2), 10-20 meters apart and often erupting almost simultaneously with ash-poor explosions and spattering (at N1_2). Over four consecutive days we recorded the activity of the three vents with the SKATE (Setup for Kinematic Acquisitions of Transient Eruptions) apparatus, which includes a high-definition high-speed camera recording 30 seconds-long videos at 250 frames per second (FPS), a thermal infrared camera continuously recording at 16 FPS and a broadband microphone continuously recording at 20 kHz. The thermal recording provided a continuous record of the activity at all vents, represented as peaks in the brightness temperature in a specific control area. The high-speed camera focused on the N1 twin vents, which were also the only ones producing sound. From the high-speed videos and the microphone we obtained the exit velocity, size and number of the pyroclasts and the amplitude and mean frequency of the acoustic radiation of the explosions, respectively, as well as the ejection onset to acoustic arrival time delay. Among the several correlations that characterize the explosion parameters, most interesting is the direct correlation in the kinetic energy of the total ejecta from N1_1 and N1_2 for joint eruptions, pointing to a common shallow pressure source that, despite vent-specific differences, kept a constant ratio of energy partitioning between the vents.
