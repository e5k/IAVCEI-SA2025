:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Milos is one of the four volcanic fields of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc.
The youngest volcanic activity in this area (Fyriplaka tuff ring andassociated lava flows) manifested around 110 to 70 ky BP. A large high enthalpy geothermal field has been present in the East Milos at least since200 ky BP. Hydrothermal fluids circulation induced an extensive alteration of the volcanic deposits outcropping in this area, creating favorableconditions for the occurrence of hydrothermal (phreatic) explosions. We aim to understand the physical dynamics that led to the extensive Late Roman Age phreatic explosions in the East Milos area. A large number of Late Roman (3^rd^-4^th^ century) pottery fragments has been observed at the base of the explosion breccias of the phreatic cones. Clusters of spectacular phreatic craters exist along the NW direction These craters have very limited diameter (around 20-30 m) and contain the Roman pottery. The depth of explosions is always less tha 40 m, clustering around 20 m. We calculated the energy of explosions and we propose cavitation of a water saturated system as explosion mechanism, probably triggered by seismic energy coming through the hydrothermal system
