:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Geochemistry of volatiles in active volcanoes provides insights into the magmatic processes at depth, such as magma evolution and degassing, which can be implemented into volcanic hazards assessment. Polar magmatic systems in Iceland represent excellent natural laboratories with numerous historical and current volcanic activity. Hydrogen, oxygen and noble gas isotopic variations in volatiles trapped in igneous rocks (subglacial glass and/or mafic crystals) of the Hofsjökull volcano provide essential information on past mechanisms controlling the eruptive history (sub- and/or post-glacial) of this large volcano with potential implications for other glacial volcanoes worldwide.
Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios reveal (i) plausible "ice-age" water contribution in the sub-glacial samples, and (ii) shifting degassing conditions from closed sub-glacial stage to open degassing system in the interglacial stages, which might be due to the decreasing glacier load. Helium isotope data reveal higher affinity to a plume origin than a MORB for its magma source (^3^He/^4^He up to 23.8 R~a~), whereas the ^4^He-^40^Ar^*^ abundance systematics of the sub-glacial glasses are inconsistent with extensive degassing possibly due to the glacial loading above the volcanic plumbing system. Integrated petrologic features infer fast magma cooling in both sub- and post-glacial samples and different chamber(s) depths.
