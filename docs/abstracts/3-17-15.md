:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Large magnitude volcanic eruptions inject prodigious quantities of SO~2~ into the atmosphere which can have major impacts on climate and society. While it is well established that SO~2~ is oxidised to sulfate (H~2~SO~4~), a range of aqueous and gaseous oxidation pathways are known and there is debate as to which is dominant. Answering this question is difficult because of the challenges of sampling volcanic plumes, yet it is critical to understanding the fate and longevity of climate-impacting S species.
Polar ice-cores capture high-time-resolution records of sulfate fallout from volcanic plumes and isotopic analysis of this sulfate can help determine the oxidation pathway. Despite this, no study has constrained S isotopes of erupted SO~2~ and compared these values to the corresponding ice-core sulfate horizon to understand and model atmospheric processing of SO~2~. Here, we examine ice-core and eruptive deposits of the 1783 Laki fissure eruption, the largest volcanic S emission of the Common Era. S isotopes of melt inclusions and matrix glass reveal characteristic degassing patterns and using mass balance we reconstruct δ^34^S of the initial SO~2~. Laki sulfate deposited in Greenland ice shows a large time evolution in δ^34^S (from -5 to +5 ‰) and a small but detectable change in Δ^33^S (~0.2 ‰). Using a plume box model (incorporating isotope fractionation) to compare data and models indicates a major role of the aqueous oxidation pathway catalysed by transition metals. This finding is consistent with recent photochemical models and emphasises the importance of including this pathway in volcanic emission scenarios.
