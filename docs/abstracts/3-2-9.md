:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The andesitic stratocone of Volcán de Colima experienced its last major explosive eruption in July 2015. This eruption began on July 10 with dome-collapse-driven block-and-ash flows, typical of Colima's recent activity, and was followed on July 11 by unprecedented open-vent, hot, scoria-rich pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) with a 10.5 km-runout. We conducted fieldwork, chemical analyses, and microtextural studies (electron-microscopy and x-ray microtomography) on the July 11 deposits to investigate the <20-hour transition between these events. Our results show that dome-collapse rapidly decompressed 1021°C, 2 wt.% H~2~O, and 58-59 wt.% SiO~2~ andesite at rates of 0.4-1.7 MPa/s from ~2 km-depth, driving magma fragmentation at strain rates of 10^-3^ s^-1^ and generating PDCs with discharge rates of 10^6^-10^7^ kg/s. Variations in decompression rates produced pulsating PDCs, reflecting heterogeneous andesite rheology influenced by multiple stages of magma genesis, ascent, storage, crystallization, and degassing. Additionally, the andesite mingled with rhyolitic melts from a mush layer at 2-5 km depths, a feature absent during prior large eruptions at Colima (1818 and 1913 Plinian events). Microtextural evidence, particularly well-preserved amphibole phenocryst nuclei from 10-15 km depth and the lack of inelastic strain in banded scoria clasts, suggests brief storage and efficient ascent through the shallow, amphibole-free mush. This mush likely tempered the eruption's explosivity in July 2015.
