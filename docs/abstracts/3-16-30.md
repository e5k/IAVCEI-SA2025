:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Ocean island basalt (OIB) magmas typically contain less than 1 wt.% H₂O, making explosive eruption styles rare. When they do occur, such eruptions are thought to be driven either from volatile-enriched mantle sources or gas segregation processes during magma differentiation. In this study, we examine crystal- and water-rich porphyritic basanites and ankaramites from El Hierro in the Canary Islands, Spain, which erupted within the ≥39 ka El Golfo giant landslide collapse embayment. Combining rock and mineral chemistry with H₂O contents of nominally anhydrous minerals (olivine and clinopyroxene), we demonstrate that despite their relatively primitive composition, the post-collapse ankaramites are not primary mantle melts. Instead, they exhibit high crystal contents and unusually high water concentrations, reaching up to 3.20 ± 0.64 wt.% H₂O. These findings suggest that they represent a normally inaccessible snapshot of dense, crystal-rich magmas residing in the sub-island underplating zone. We hypothesize that their eruption was triggered by sudden decompression due to crustal unloading, implying that the El Golfo landslide may have influenced deeper parts of the magmatic plumbing system. This event likely facilitated the ascent of volatile-rich, crystal-laden magmas from the underplating zone. Based on these observations, we propose that some "wet" and explosive ocean island eruptions may result from the rise of deep-seated, water-rich magmas following vertical unloading and associated decompression.
