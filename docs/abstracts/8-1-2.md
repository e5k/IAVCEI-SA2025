A novel X-ray transparent Internally Heated Pressure Vessel (IHPV) has been developed to enable synchrotron X-ray radiography and microtomography at high temperatures (up to 1250°C) and pressures (up to 200 MPa), providing in situ observation of material processes. Tested at DLS (United Kingdom) and ESRF (France) synchrotron facilities, the IHPV has been used to study vesiculation and crystallization in basaltic magmatic systems, offering insights into key processes like crystallization, degassing, gas bubble formation, and magma mixing. Traditionally, high-pressure, high-temperature properties of materials such as geomaterials and alloys were analysed in quenched final products at room temperature. Recent advances in imaging techniques like two-dimensional radiography and three-dimensional microtomography allow for direct observation of processes such as melting, vesiculation, and crystallization in real time. This development is particularly valuable for quantifying vesiculation and crystallization in volcanic systems under natural magmatic conditions, improving our understanding of magma evolution and eruption forecasting. Previous studies have been limited to shallow depths due to apparatus constraints, but this novel IHPV enables experiments at deeper crustal pressures, where critical processes occur. In addition to its applications in geosciences, this technology can be applied to material science, studying high-temperature and high-pressure behaviours in various materials.
