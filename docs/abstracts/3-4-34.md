:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The Ulukışla Caldera (a structure of 2.5 km x 4 km) is part of the Hasandağ Volcanic Complex (Central Anatolia, Turkey) and has been only recently identified as a collapse structure surrounded by several undifferentiated pyroclastic deposits until this study. This study presents a tephrostratigraphic analysis to reconstruct the origin and volcanic evolution of Ulukışla Caldera, examining its volcano-tectonic relationship with the Tuz Gölü Fault Zone (TGFZ). To achieve this, we integrated detailed volcano-stratigraphy, deposit descriptions and distribution, glass chemistry, geochronology, and remote sensing. We identified three major eruption deposits: 1) the ~442 ka pre-caldera Yenipınar Ignimbrite, 2) the ~400 ka Belbaşhanı caldera-forming ignimbrite, and 3) the ~326 ka post-caldera Ulukışla Fall. Since the Ulukışla Caldera is emplaced within (semi-) grabens of the TGFZ, synthetic and antithetic faults have facilitated the formation of the strike-slip/graben caldera. This active fault system may also control the volcanic activity across the entire Hasandağ compound volcano. Recognising this potential volcanic-tectonic relationship is essential for understanding future eruptive behaviour of such volcanic system. Given the Hasandağ's location within this complex tectonic setting, the possibility of a new cone gravitational collapse (e.g., Greater and Lesser Hasandağ) and/or the formation of additional volcanic collapse structures should be included in future volcanic/tectonic hazard assessments.
This study has been funded by the PÜSKÜRÜM project (a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action (grant #101024337) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme) and the TURVO project (PID2023-147255NB-I00), supported by MICIU/AEI/10.13039/50110001103.
