Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) and speckle offset data are used to measure ground deformation. Computing deformation time series from these data can be challenging due to varying radar line-of-sight acquisition geometry, rapid coherence loss, and the large datasets involved requiring computationally intensive processing. The Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) Software is designed to compute deformation time series from these data, and its parallelized version is optimized to handle large datasets from modern SAR satellites. The software can produce 1D, 2D, and 3D Surface-Parallel and Aspect-Parallel Flow constrained and 3D unconstrained or 4D deformation time series. It runs on workstations and clusters utilizing OpenMP and MPI/OpenMP. This study presents novel results demonstrating MSBAS capabilities.
