:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The Puyehue-Cordón Caulle Volcanic Complex has been one of the most active silicic volcanic centers globally in the last century with three large silicic eruption that produced both extensive lavas and Plinian fall deposits. The most recent 2011-12 eruption also produced a shallow intrusion (approximately 200 m below the surface) that uplifted the landscape by hundreds of meters, modified the conduit of the eruption modulating the explosive-effusive transition, and enhanced an already vigorous near-surface hydrothermal system. The processes of intrusion emplacement and the continued changes in the subsurface and the landscapes are the focus of an ongoing multi-national, multi-disciplinary study named the "Caulle Hazards and their Interplay during Laccolith Continuous Observations" (CHILCO). By integrating data from petrology, volcanology, water chemistry, geodesy, gravity with structural measurements, magnetic, landscape and thermal surveys we develop refined models for the emplacement of the shallow intrusion and its temporal and spatial evolution both in the sub-surface and mass redistributions on the surface and its surroundings. Furthermore, these studies inform potential evolving and emerging hazards related to this over-steepened landscape that remains underlain by the voluminous, actively deforming magmatic system, which fed the past three eruptions (and likely several more in Holocene times). Here we summarize the latest findings of our multi-year observational array that started in 2022 and invite additional collaborative research opportunities that complement our ongoing investigations.
