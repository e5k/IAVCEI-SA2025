:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Effusive eruptions can generate large lava flow fields reaching great distances from the main vent, expanding along volcano flanks by developing channels and structures whose shape and extension depend on magma properties, topographic features (slope and roughness), effusion rate and emplacement duration. The formation of lava tubes is one of the main causes which determine the further maximum extension of a lava flow. The development of a stable crust around a moving lava, caused by cooling, significantly decreases the exchange of heat between lava and the atmosphere. This phenomenon is extremely significant in the case of volcanoes producing voluminous lava effusions and characterized by a steady effusion rate (e.g. Hawaii and Etna), but it was described also in explosive volcanoes with a lower rate of lava flow production (e.g. Vesuvius). Studies focused on qualitatively describing the development of lava tubes in lava flow fields, but few works examined quantitatively the physical process of lava tube formation and there are even fewer that examine the mechanisms responsible for the formation of lava tubes by multidisciplinary data. Our project TUBES (undersTanding lava tUBe formation and preservation) is focused on a detailed volcanological, petrological, physical analysis, structural analysis (e.g. guided wave analysis, acoustic emission testing) and numerical modeling of the effusive phase of Vesuvius and Etna, focusing on understanding the mechanisms behind the formation of lava tubes. TUBES has the aim to expand our knowledge about the processes at the basis of lava flow emplacement providing information for volcanic hazard and risk assessment.
