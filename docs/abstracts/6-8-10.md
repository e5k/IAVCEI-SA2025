:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Astroni is a 2×1 km wide crater in the Campi Flegrei caldera (southern Italy) hosting three small lakes, namely Lago Grande (LG), Cofaniello Grande (CG), and Cofaniello Piccolo (CP), presenting a varied ecosystem rich in reeds, bulrushes and willows. In this study, possible relationships between the lakes and the hydrothermal fluid circulation system were investigated based on geochemical data of the lakes and microbiological analyses of lake waters and sediments. Lake chemistry, showing a Na^+^-HCO~3~^-^ facies and relatively high TDS values (up to 1,820 mg/L), was consistent to that typically found in discharges located at the periphery of upflow zones of active hydrothermal-volcanic systems. LG was characterized by an anoxic hypolimnion with relevant concentrations of biogenic CH~4~ and a mixture of biogenic and hydrothermal CO~2~. The dependence of the chemistry of the Astroni lakes on inputs from the Campi Flegrei hydrothermal system may explain the anomalous increase of the LG water level recorded in the last years, which was not consistent with the temporal pattern of rainfall in that area and never observed before. The increasing hydraulic pressure related to the enhanced hydrothermal steam condensation recorded in the last decades can indeed have caused the observed change in the LG water volume. The increase of the LG water level, besides acting as an indicator for the volcanic crisis, may have a strong environmental impact, since it affects the terrestrial and aquatic compartments of the Astroni crater, with direct consequences on the unique ecosystem functioning of the lakes.
