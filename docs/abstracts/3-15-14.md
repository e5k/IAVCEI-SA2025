:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Monitoring and forecasting volcanic plumes are crucial for detecting, characterizing, and assessing associated hazards. However, advanced monitoring tools, such as thermal cameras, can be expensive and unavailable in many monitoring networks. To address this, a cost-effective visible-wavelength camera network has been developed to capture high-resolution imagery for volcano monitoring.
This network provides continuous, automated image acquisition from different locations around a volcanic edifice. Each camera node is equipped with a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, a Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3, and a water- and dust-proof box for deployment in challenging outdoor environments, with an estimated cost of approximately 75 USD per unit. The system supports diverse configurations, including adjustable capture intervals and resolutions, to meet various observational needs. The network adapts its operation based on environmental conditions, automatically selecting the shutter speed during daylight and using specific settings at night. Images are transferred daily to a server for archival and analysis.
Initial tests conducted at Mt. Etna (Italy) demonstrate its reliability in capturing images over extended periods under variable lighting and weather conditions (e.g., high temperatures, rain). The network can also be easily used as a temporary system for field campaigns. By using open-source hardware and software, this camera network provides a flexible, accessible tool for researchers. If paired with GSM connection, and solar panels or battery packs, the system can potentially be integrated into multi-sensor monitoring systems also in remote areas.
