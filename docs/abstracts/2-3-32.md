:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The Chiles-Cerro Negro Volcanic Complex, located on the Ecuador-Colombia border, has exhibited unrest since early 2022. Observed phenomena include 8 cm of uplift near the Chiles edifice, seismic swarms, and mild superficial changes in thermal springs. Nearby, the Potrerillos caldera (10 km south) has shown significant ground deformation, with uplift reaching 60 mm/year.
To investigate these activities, gravity monitoring began in June 2022. Surveys covered six sites on Chiles' southern flank and five near Potrerillos. Between July and October 2022, gravity measurements at Chiles indicated a 65 µGal decrease, followed by an equivalent increase by April 2023. After April, gravity changes near Chiles stabilized, while Potrerillos' sites showed a continuous gravity increase reaching up to 45 µGal, alongside ongoing uplift through November 2024.
Preliminary results from inversion of geodetic datasets show evidence for two different sources of mass change: a loss of more than 3x10^11^ kg occurred in Chiles' southern flank between July and October 2022, followed by a similar mass increase in the following months. Additionally, a continuous mass gain 10 to 15 km below Potrerillos Caldera was modelled, with a maximum increase of 7x10^12^ kg between July 2022 and November 2024.
Two potential scenarios explain these observations: (1) a single magmatic source near Potrerillos driving fluid migration towards Chiles along fault systems, resembling the 2014 unrest, or (2) two independent sources of mass change beneath Chiles and Potrerillos. By analyzing gravity data, we aim to identify the most likely scenario and its implications for volcanic activity forecasting.
