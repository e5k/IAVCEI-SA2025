Open vent volcanoes present unparalleled opportunities to observe volcanic processes. Mt Michael is an enigmatic mafic open vent volcano in the South Sandwich volcanic arc. Recurrent thermal hotspots in multispectral satellite imagery have motivated speculation around the existence of a persistent lava lake. We explore temporal variability in open vent behaviour at Mt Michael from the ground and from space. We combine in situ observations of gas composition, emission rate, and thermal imaging with long-term records of SO~2~ and thermal emissions from satellite remote sensing to evaluate in form what magma is present at the surface and the stability of that geometry over time, determine whether gas and thermal emissions are coupled over timescales of months to years, and explain these observations in the context of the transport and storage of magma and volatiles. We measured an SO~2~ flux of 135 t/d in November 2022, consistent with a concurrent satellite-based (TROPOMI) flux 120 ± 40 t/d. More energetic pulses occurred periodically every few minutes, with peaks in SO~2~ flux up to 605 t/d. Deconvolving magmatic and low-temperature fumarole sources within our volcanic gas timeseries, we derive molar CO~2~/SO~2~ ratios of 2.1 and 5.0, respectively. Multiple vents contribute to thermal radiative power, varying between 1 and 3 in number but always in the same locations, suggesting a well-established shallow conduit geometry. We suggest that stable open vent behaviour at Mt Michael has been sustained over decades and is transitional between a classic small lava lake and a multi-vent open system volcano.
