:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Since 2017, the University of Palermo and the Geological Survey of Colombia have collaborated to enhance the role of volcanic gas monitoring in forecasting eruptions and mitigating volcanic hazards in Colombia. This ongoing partnership focuses on the Nevado del Ruiz, Purace, and Galeras volcanoes. Here, we summarize results gathered over approximately seven years (2017--present) and highlight significant shifts in volcanic activity during this period, such as the Nevado del Ruiz crisis (July 2021-October 2022 and March-June 2023) and the Purace crisis (May-July 2024). We present data from permanent multi-sensor gas monitoring stations installed at Nevado del Ruiz, along with gas composition surveys conducted at Galeras and Purace. Additionally, we introduce new data from a semi-permanent ultraviolet (UV) camera installed at Nevado del Ruiz and explore the potential for integrating both UV camera and Novac network data to obtain more accurate estimates of daily SO₂ fluxes. This integration is particularly crucial at high altitudes, where seasonal wind patterns (e.g., direction and speed) can introduce significant errors in SO₂ flux estimates. Furthermore, the implementation of novel acquisition and automated data processing techniques from our permanent gas stations facilitates the development of volcanic gas monitoring protocols suitable for contexts with real-time data transmission capabilities. Ultimately, our volcanic gas data are combined with ongoing petrological investigations of these volcanic systems, particularly Nevado del Ruiz, to assess their current state of unrest and the likelihood of future eruptions.
