:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Open Volcanology requires research infrastructure that supports the persistent sharing and curation of research products including data, software, and samples. IEDA^2^ is a unique collaborative data infrastructure funded by the US National Science Foundation that operates data services relevant for the volcanology community, including publication and preservation of geochemical, geochronological, mineralogical, petrological, and other sample-based data (EarthChem Library, PetDB, Library of Experimental Phase Relations, EarthChem Portal); human- and machine-readable interfaces for accessing high quality, curated data; and a digital environment for physical samples that support discovery and reuse of samples and their integration with the digital research data ecosystem (System for Earth & Extraterrestrial Sample Registration SESAR^2^). The EarthChem Portal
By combining the operation of technical infrastructure, data curation, user support and training, community engagement, and international collaboration with relevant data facilities IEDA^2^ enables open, reproducible, and transparent science practices in volcanology. Among IEDA^2^'s services that are specifically tailored to volcanology is the Volcano Portal that allows researchers to simultaneously find and access data in multiple data systems that store and manage data for volcanoes, including the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program database of volcanic activity data; the EarthChem Library and the EarthChem Portal; the SESAR sample catalog; the Italian MaGa database of compositional and flux data of gases released at volcanic and non-volcanic degassing sites; OpenTopography (LIDAR data); and data system of the EarthScope Consortium. Partnering with the tephra community IEDA^2^ is now developing the Tephra Information Portal which will also be presented in this session.
