:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The Earth Sciences have traditionally relied on field excursions as experiential training for undergraduate and graduate students. Although these opportunities can provide important opportunities to learn about primary data collection and field processes, they can also be challenging learning environments regarding logistics and accessibility, limiting participation and educational benefits for diverse student groups. In an effort to ensure that field components of courses at the University of Oregon are inclusive, equitable, and accessible, we created a combination of policies and templates for instructors to use before and during field excursions. Elements of these procedures include: (1) pre-field trip surveys for students to broadly share expectations, background, accessibility limitations, and concerns; (2) detailed field trip narratives with emergency contacts, communication availability, food and water information, gear lists, field locations, cultural information, terrain and natural hazards, and schedules; and (3) field trip code of conduct for students and instructors. The detailed documents aided an international volcanology field trip to New Zealand, facilitated complicated travel logistics, and emphasized effective place-based science with cultural significance included with each geology stop. For an undergraduate-focused field volcanology course in Oregon, the pre-field trip survey allowed students to share their concerns and questions before the trip, enabling the instructor and teaching assistants to better serve the students who had not been in the field before, ultimately enhancing overall learning outcomes. While these steps required some new field trip planning, department-wide adoption of these standards and templates has eased the overall effort and made field learning more accessible.
