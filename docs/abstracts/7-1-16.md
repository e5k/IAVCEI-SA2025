:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Nisyros Geopark, located in the Southeastern Aegean, is a candidate for the UNESCO Global Geoparks Network due to its unique volcanic heritage and its integration of geological, natural, and cultural elements. Spanning 481 km², it encompasses the active volcano of Nisyros and surrounding islands, forming a natural and cultural mosaic shaped by the dynamics of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc. The geopark encompasses 24 geosites, including active hydrothermal craters, a collapse caldera, volcanic domes, and numerous hot springs along the coastline.
In recent years, extensive efforts have been made to highlight and disseminate the volcanic geoheritage of Nisyros, targeting both local residents and a wider audience. Key initiatives include educational programs, workshops, guided tours, and summer schools, which connect people to the island's extraordinary geological and cultural history. The Geopark also leverages modern communication tools, such as mobile applications and its dedicated website (www.nisyrosgeopark.gr), to ensure accessibility and engagement with diverse audiences.
The geopark's outreach aims not only to educate but also seeks to strengthen awareness and appreciation of its unique volcanic environment. By fostering partnerships with schools, universities, and cultural organizations, it strives to embed the importance of volcanic geoheritage into the collective consciousness of the local community and visitors alike. The integration of scientific research, cultural traditions, and innovative communication techniques positions Nisyros Geopark as a vital link between the volcanic past and the broader public, ensuring that its geoheritage is celebrated, understood, and preserved for generations to come.
