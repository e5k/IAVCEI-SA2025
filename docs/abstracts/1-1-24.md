:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Redox conditions in magmatic environments control phase equilibria and the behavior of volatiles like sulfur. Understanding the interplay between oxygen fugacity (*f*O~2~) and magmatic differentiation provides insights into the roles of magmatism and volcanic degassing in Earth's redox evolution. However, there are only a few studies on oxybarometric methods calibrated at elevated pressure and water content, conditions typical of magma differentiation at convergent plate boundaries.
We conducted experiments (Pressure (*P*) = 200 MPa, Temperature (*T*): 1020−920 °C, log*f*O~2~: -1 to +3.5 log∆FMQ) to develop oxybarometers based on vanadium (V) partitioning between mafic minerals and hydrous silicate melts. The results show that V partitioning is largely independent of  *P*, *T*, and silicate melt composition (*X*). For olivine-silicate melt pairs, the V partition coefficient (D~V~[Ol/melt]) is modeled using a sigmoidal regression equation:
log*f*O~2~(∆FMQ) = LOGX~0~-log~10~[([(A~2~-y)/(y-A~1~)-1)]^2^)^0.5^]/p,
with A~1~ = -3.10 ± 0.13, A~2~ = 1.30 ± 0.12, LOGX~0~ = -1.98 ± 0.25, p = -0.10 ± 0.01, and y = logD~V~[Ol/melt].
This equation reproduces *f*O~2~ within a 2σ median error of one log unit over a wide range of *T*-*P*-*X*. This study expands previous data for olivine to lower temperatures and higher water activities, improving robustness and reducing calibration error. It also highlights the influence of *f*O~2~ on fractional crystallization in intermediate magmas at subduction zones. The olivine-based oxybarometer is applicable to mafic volcanic rocks with suitable silicate melt inclusion-host mineral pairs for reconstructing magma reservoir redox histories. For more evolved magmatic systems, orthopyroxenes and amphiboles offer additional potential to similarly constrain *f*O~2~.
