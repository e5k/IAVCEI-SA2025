This research focuses on the heterogeneity analysis of intermediate composition lavas from the Fogo Volcano (or Água de Pau Volcano, Azores, Portugal) using the through-transmission method, standardised determination of water absorption by capillarity, and X-ray microtomography. Ultrasonic velocities and capillarity absorption were measured along three orthogonal directions in six cubic specimens to assess how pore structure varies and influences rock physics parameters. Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) was determined in three cores from a single cube. The bimodal pore size distribution leads to an anomalous capillary imbibition, with two absorption processes described as additive by the applied Sharp Front model. Capillary-connected porosity (5.07%) is lower than total connected porosity (18.5--20.1%), as gravitational fluid transport dominates due to large pores (>1 mm). P-wave velocities (2802--3208 m/s) are largely insensitive to pore shape, while Vp/Vs ratios (1.76 ± 0.25), dynamic Young's modulus (16.78 ± 3.20 GPa), and Poisson's ratio (0.23 ± 0.11) reflect vesicular textures independent of vesicle orientation. Simulated core permeability (0.7--6.6 mD) decreases with increased tortuosity despite higher connected porosity in some samples. UCS ranges from 15.5 to 36.0 MPa and depends on pore size, shape, orientation to the loading direction, and connected porosity. Failure occurs by tensile splitting, with fractures initiating at pore edges and plagioclase phenocryst borders. While capillarity and Vp/Vs ratios show limited directional variation, vesicle shape and size affect strength and fluid transport mechanisms. These findings highlight the heterogeneous physical characteristics of lavas, providing insights for interpreting field measurements and enhancing volcano stability models.
