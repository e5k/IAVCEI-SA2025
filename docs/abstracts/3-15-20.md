:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Stromboli volcano provides a natural laboratory for studying dynamic volcanic processes through high-frequency, multi-parameter monitoring techniques. We analyzed over 300 explosions collected between 2019 and 2024 using acoustic, UV, thermal, high-definition and high-speed recordings, acquired both independently and integratedly with SKATE (Setup for Kinematic Acquisitions of Transient Eruptions). Synergetic data analysis reveals distinct degassing patterns, eruption styles, and correlations between acoustic and SO₂ signals and explosion parameters.
Explosion-emitted SO₂ masses exhibit spatial variability, with northeastern vents consistently contributing higher gas budgets. Over short periods, explosions maintain vent-specific SO₂ masses aligned with acoustic characteristics, such as peak-to-peak amplitude and mean frequency. Notably, gas-dominated, jets-like events from a hornito demonstrated unique acoustic signatures, linking explosion types with acoustic features.
In May 2023, three active vents were dominated by specific explosion types: 1) gas rich, with low acoustic amplitudes and slow ejection speeds and long duration; 2) bomb-and-ash rich, more powerful with higher amplitudes, lower mean frequencies and larger bomb elevations, and 3) bomb-rich, with intermediate bomb elevation and acoustic amplitude, and lower SO₂ emissions. Despite consistent short-term patterns, long-term vent characteristics exhibit variability, reflecting changes in physical source mechanisms.
These findings highlight the importance of keeping a long-term (scale of years) record of high-frequency (scale of seconds) observations in capturing nuanced eruption dynamics. Only the integration of diverse datasets fully highlights the complex interplay between gas emissions, eruption styles, and acoustic features at open vent basaltic systems.
