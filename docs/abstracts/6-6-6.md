:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Volcanic eruptions pose health risks dominantly through gas and ash emissions, with respiratory effects being a primary concern for exposed populations. By combining confocal laser microscopy, spectroscopic analysis, and biological experiments to characterize the 3D morphology and chemical composition of respirable volcanic ash particles (PM10 and PM2.5), insights into potential toxicity mechanisms can be gained. Analysis of silicate ash from the 2021 Tajogaite eruption (La Palma, Spain) revealed angular particles with distinctive sharp surface features and salts adhering to their surfaces. Experiments *in vitro* with human primary bronchial epithelial cells demonstrated enhanced pneumococcal bacterial adhesion in ash-exposed cells compared to control cells, indicating that fine volcanic ash exposure may increase susceptibility to respiratory infections. Pneumococcal adhesion also increases in a dose-dependent manner: more ash exposure carries higher infection possibility. The smallest particles, which can be remobilized long after eruption cessation, therefore present an ongoing hazard. This integrated analytical approach provides insights into respiratory health risks in populations exposed to volcanic ash, with particular relevance for regions like the Canary Islands where communities face ongoing exposure to both volcanic ash and other inorganic particulates. The methodology presents a rapid and effective framework for assessing health hazards associated with respirable volcanic particles, enabling better risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
