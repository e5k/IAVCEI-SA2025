:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Explosive silicic volcanism of the Carpathian-Pannonian Region (CPR) is increasingly recognized as the primary source of tephra across the Alpine-Mediterranean region (AMR) during Early and Middle Miocene. This calls for a unified tephrostratigraphic framework for this period of volcanic activity to resolve the nature, extent, scale and frequency of large silicic eruptions of the CPR, as well as conditions of magma genesis, the timing of changing depositional environments, and climate-related weathering regimes.
Here, we present new volcanological, sedimentological, petrological, high-precision and *in situ* zircon geochronological, and zircon and volcanic glass compositional data from distal Lower and Middle Miocene volcaniclastic (e.g., ignimbrites and ashfalls) and residual (e.g., karst bauxites) deposits from southwestern CPR and the Dinarides. We integrate new and existing datasets to provide new constraints on the volcanic history and petrogenesis of the CPR, which occurred between ~18.1 Ma and ~16.8 Ma. Recognition of at least seven regionally extensive Early Miocene volcanic events suggests that large volume CPR ignimbrite-forming eruptions were more frequent, widespread and larger than previously considered. The multi-proxy approach applied on a distal record of the ~14.32 Ma silicic eruption of the CPR, stored within the Dinaride Lake System, implies more frequent CPR explosive volcanism during the Middle Miocene and permits us to interpret the emplacement of over-thickened volcaniclastic deposits as volcaniclastic turbidites. Finally, we unravel the Dinaridic residual record of the long-lasting Oligo--Miocene volcanic history of the AMR as well as the timing of intense chemical weathering at mid-latitudes during this time period.
