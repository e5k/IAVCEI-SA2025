:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Our understanding of pyroclastic density currents has been largely driven by analysis of the deposits they leave behind (and evidence of bypass or erosion). Despite significant advances, there remain fundamental gaps in our knowledge of PDC processes, how these change with time and space, and how they result in high mobility and destructive behaviours.
We lack quantitative descriptions to link eruption behaviours and environmental conditions to current processes. There is a disparity between the field data typically collected and the input/output parameters needed for the analogue and numerical models that aim to simulate key processes. Models that test relationships between deposit properties and the currents that formed them are critical, but are hindered by a lack of systematically collected, comparable, quantified field datasets to both inform and validate them.
There is a vast literature describing and interpreting PDC deposits, although; (1) there is no consistent approach to characterisation, measurement or sampling of deposits in the field; (2) a proliferation of laboratory techniques has led to increased quantification of sample characteristics, but there is a lack of standard reporting practices, including uncertainty reporting; (3) the highly variable nature of deposits is rarely captured in publications reporting deposit properties.
Here we propose a new framework, intended to be a rigorous approach to PDC field data collection and reporting that can be used to inform, benchmark and validate numerical and analogue models. The framework includes directly comparable, standardised metrics and measuring protocols for quantifying and modelling the sedimentation of PDC deposits.
