Dike intrusions during rifting events frequently reactivate pre-existing tectonic structures, as observed in Afar (Ethiopia) and Iceland. While surface observations and geophysical methods provide insights into these processes, direct observations of rupture dynamics in the upper crust remain understudied. We conducted analogue experiments to model magma injection and its interaction with tectonic structures in an extensional regime. We simulated extension-induced fracturing and subsequent magma injection under controlled conditions, varying the extension amount and injection rate, using granular materials to represent the brittle upper crust.
Our results show that dike morphologies form only when the host rock is under extensional strain, with magma propagation guided by pre-existing fractures. Surface deformations, including graben deepening and uplift, are consistent with natural examples and predominantly accommodated by reactivated faults rather than new fracture formations. Significant strike-slip components (conjugate fault systems) observed at the model surface, near dike tips, show that magma propagation can locally overprint the tectonic signature. These findings highlight the central role played by magma in upper crustal deformation during rifting events, underscoring the interaction between tectonic extension and magma-driven processes. The results have implications for hazard assessment, highlighting the importance of mapping pre-existing structures and their reactivation potential in magmatically active regions.
