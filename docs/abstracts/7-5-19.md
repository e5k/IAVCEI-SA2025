:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

We are advancing towards automation and standardized methodologies for processing volcano monitoring data, leveraging datasets from global volcanoes. Funded by Singapore National Research Foundation, this five-year initiative utilizes publicly accessible seismic waveform datasets, existing collaborations, historical volcanic activity records, and eruption phases. By integrating automation into data workflows, the project accelerates analysis, enhances accuracy, and minimizes human error. Standardized protocols ensure systematic data handling, promoting reliable findings and enabling effective comparisons across volcanoes and time periods. Together, these approaches improve decision-making for volcanic hazard mitigation, expedite analysis, and contribute to comprehensive repositories like WOVOdat, fostering global scientific collaboration. The project places a strong emphasis on capacity building through open-source tools and training programs, actively engaging students and volcano observatory staff. Participants gain hands-on experience analysing seismic activity related to volcanic processes before, during, and after eruptions. Feedback from observatory staff ensures ground-truth validation and guides improvements to the techniques and tools developed. By encompassing diverse volcanic activities, magma compositions, and tectonic settings, the project aims to advance understanding of volcanic processes and enhance preparedness efforts for volcanic hazards worldwide.
