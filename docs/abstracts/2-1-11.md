Identifying the transition from volcanic quiescence to unrest remains a critical challenge in volcano monitoring. This study advances our understanding of volcanic state transitions by analyzing continuous seismic records from three volcanic systems: Askja (Iceland), Aso (Japan), and Gareloi (Alaska, USA). We employ a multi-parametric approach combining seismic velocity changes (dv/v), kernel sensitivity analysis, and seismic attenuation measurements to track subsurface evolution over time.
We integrate ambient noise cross-correlation using MSNoise to compute attenuation and detect seismic velocity changes, with source locations constrained by surface wave kernel sensitivity across different frequencies and velocity models.
Results show distinct patterns of unrest across sites. At Askja, we detected a pronounced decrease in dv/v at approximately 2 km depth in August 2021, concomitant with increased attenuation, shallow microseismicity, and the initiation of surface uplift (80 cm over three years). At Aso, the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake induced an immediate 0.5% decrease in dv/v, followed by a healing process and increased attenuation, interrupted six months later by an eruption marked by 0.3% dv/v decrease. At Gareloi, 2021 seismic unrest is characterized by tremor and persistent long-period events over three months, corresponding with a 1% dv/v decrease at roughly 3 km depth.
These diverse case studies demonstrate how continuous monitoring of seismic velocity changes and attenuation reveals both gradual and sudden transitions in volcanic systems. In addition, our findings establish baseline behaviors for these volcanoes and highlight characteristic seismic signatures associated with unrest, thereby advancing our capability to detect and interpret potential precursors to volcanic eruptions.
