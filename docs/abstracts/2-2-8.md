In the context of escalating climate change impacts and heightened frequency of natural disasters, the imperative for robust multi-hazard assessment and proactive mitigation strategies has become evident. Tenerife (Canary Islands), situated in the Atlantic archipelago, encapsulates the challenges faced by communities globally, prompting a paradigm shift towards anticipatory disaster management. This study presents a pioneering effort to establish a multi-hazard database for regions impacted by multiple natural hazards, using Tenerife as a case study, to provide a foundation for accurate risk assessments and decision-making. Our methodology involved collection and analysis of 500 years of historical data on volcanic activity, earthquakes, floods, landslides, and extreme weather events, allowing us to identify patterns, vulnerabilities, and resilience measures. Our approach aims to empower stakeholders with a nuanced understanding of natural processes. The database reveals patterns in hazard occurrence and impacts, such as frequent floods linked to heavy rainfall and ravine overflows. It also highlights increasing frequency and severity of these events in recent decades. Other hazards, like rockfalls and landslides, pose risks in areas affected by human activities. Key recommendations include ravine cleaning, water retention areas, reforestation, enhanced geotechnical studies, and slope stabilization efforts to mitigate landslide risks. This approach is applicable to Tenerife but serves as a model for other regions facing multi-hazard scenarios. By leveraging historical insights alongside contemporary methodologies, this contribution aims to strengthen resilience and inform mitigation strategies.
