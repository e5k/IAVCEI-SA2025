Surface roughness is a key indicator of volcanic flow properties and eruption dynamics, with terrestrial basaltic flows in Hawai'i offering valuable analogs for planetary studies. Using MESSENGER's Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) data, we investigate the roughness of Mercurian lava flows to better understand Mercury's volcanic history and compare it to LiDAR-derived surface characteristics of Hawaiian basalts. This study aims to assess whether variations in surface roughness of Mercurian lava flows, despite modification by impact gardening, align with broader-scale features observed in Hawaiian basaltic terrains, providing insight into flow dynamics and volcanic activity. We analyze MLA topographic data for regions on Mercury with volcanic plains, applying roughness metrics comparable to those derived from terrestrial studies of Hawaiian basalts. Metrics such as height deviation and slope variation are used to evaluate Mercurian flow characteristics and their potential correlation with the surface morphologies of basaltic lava flows in Hawai'i. Preliminary analyses indicate that the roughness of Mercurian lava flows exhibits spatial variability that may correspond to terrestrial analogs, with smoother regions potentially reflecting Pāhoehoe-like flows and rougher areas resembling 'A'ā-like flows, despite surface-altering processes. By relating Mercury's surface roughness to the morphologies of Hawaiian lava flows, this study provides insight into Mercury's volcanic processes and the broader implications of planetary lava flow dynamics. Our findings suggest that even under varying planetary conditions, surface roughness can serve as a comparative tool, bridging terrestrial and planetary volcanology.
