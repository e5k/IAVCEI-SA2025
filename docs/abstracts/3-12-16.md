:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Several mechanisms contribute to electrification during explosive volcanic eruptions, including fracto-emission from fragmentation and tribo-electrification from particle collisions. This electrification explains the occurrence of volcanic lightning and enhances aggregation by increasing electrostatic attraction and sticking efficiencies between ash particles. The resulting larger aggregates settle faster than individual particles, affecting sedimentation rates and particle residence time in the atmosphere. However, direct measurements of electrical charges on volcanic ash particles remain rare, limiting our understanding of how ash electrification influences aggregation. Additionally, laboratory experiments are needed to assess the impact of electrical charges on sticking efficiencies.
This study presents a cost-effective, portable device designed to quantify the charge and fall velocity of individual volcanic ash particles and aggregates. Using a charge amplifier circuit and an Arduino microcontroller, the device records the very small voltages induced by charged particles crossing a Through-Type Faraday Cage (TTFC). The device was deployed in two field campaigns at Sakurajima volcano (Japan, November 2023) and Etna volcano (Italy, July 2024). At Sakurajima, charges ranging from 0.5 to 150 pC and settling velocities of 0.1 to 5 m/s were detected, with aggregates observed in deposits despite low explosive activity. In contrast, no charges or aggregates were observed at Etna during high-intensity paroxysmal explosions. Differences in fragmentation, grain size distribution, or atmospheric conditions may explain this discrepancy.
The device was also used in preliminary laboratory experiments focusing on the collision and eventual sticking of charged particles, proving its utility in both field and laboratory settings.
