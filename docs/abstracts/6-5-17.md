:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The Hawaiian Islands are basaltic shield volcanoes formed by the Hawaiian hot spot. Five subaerial volcanoes---Kīlauea, Mauna Loa, Hualālai, Haleakalā, and Mauna Kea---are deemed active or potentially active, and lava flows are a primary hazard from an eruption at any of these volcanoes. The relative hazard posed by lava flows varies across the islands, dependent on factors including eruption style (related to a volcano's age and position relative to the Hawaiian hot spot), the location of potential vent areas, and local topography.
At the time of writing (January 2025), the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory is in the final stages of developing a lava flow hazard assessment for the entire State of Hawaii, which incorporates, updates, and revises past lava flow hazard assessments for parts of the state, including the 1992 *Map Showing Lava-Flow Hazard Zones, Island of Hawaii* by Wright and others. The state-wide assessment incorporates new geologic mapping, less well-known lava flow hazard maps from other islands, research, and an improved understanding of lava flow hazards. Additionally, zone definitions have been revised to be clearer and easier to understand, and special care has been given to ensure new hazard map is accessible for all users.
In this contribution, we will share our process of updating, revising and expanding this important and iconic hazard map. If is published by the time of the IAVCEI Scientific Assembly, we will reveal the *Long-Term Lava Flow Hazard Zone Map for the State of Hawaii.*
