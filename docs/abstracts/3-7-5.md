The Acigöl caldera (Cappadocian region, Turkey) offers a compelling case study of how small-scale, monogenetic-type eruptions, can initiate cascading volcanic processes culminating in large-scale, caldera-forming events. A detailed tephrostratigraphic analysis of a key outcrop within the Acigöl caldera, supported by glass chemistry and geochronological data, reveals a continuous sequence of volcanic deposits --- including a debris avalanche, tephra ring, plinian fall, ignimbrite, and lava dome --- indicative of rapid, successive eruptions without significant hiatuses. This study highlights how minor phreatomagmatic events, such the Taskesik maar, can serve as the initial trigger in a sequence of eruptions that ultimately lead to caldera roof collapse. This progression includes a Plinian phase along caldera ring fractures, which depressurizes the magma chamber and facilitates the subsidence of lithospheric blocks. Our findings underscore the importance of recognizing small-scale eruptions as potential precursors to major caldera-forming events, emphasizing their significance for improving hazard assessment strategies in active caldera systems, particularly those in densely populated areas such the turistic region of Cappadocia.
