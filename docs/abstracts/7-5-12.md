:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

WOVOdat, the World Organization of Volcano Observatories database, serves as a centralized repository for global volcano unrest data. Built on a MySQL structure, it is accessible through the user-friendly web interface, **wovodat.org**, providing a valuable resource for researchers and decision-makers. We introduce a web service tool that simplifies access to WOVOdat's extensive datasets, enabling users to efficiently retrieve tailored data using structured query scripts. Key parameters, such as volcano name, data type, and time range, can be customized to extract relevant data in a standardized format over HTTP.  The web service tool is designed to handle large datasets effectively, offering the volcano community a user-friendly and flexible approach to accessing unrest data. Integration with an Application Programming Interface (API) further enhances the tool's functionality by enabling automated data retrieval and seamless integration with external tools, supporting advanced analyses and workflows. By streamlining access to WOVOdat's comprehensive datasets, the tool facilitates the identification of precursory patterns, improves eruption forecasting, and enables comparative studies of volcanic behavior across systems. This functionality deepens our understanding of volcanic processes and hazards, supports analogue studies, and contributes to advancing knowledge of volcanic activity and its associated risks. The tool represents a significant step forward in leveraging digital technologies for volcanic research and risk mitigation.
