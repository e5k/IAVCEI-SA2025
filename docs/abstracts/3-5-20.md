:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Volcanoes strongly influence the hydrogeomorphic dynamics of rivers that drain their flanks. Fluvial systems affected by explosive volcanism exhibit some of the highest sediment yields observed on Earth, with much of this yield being driven by hazardous lahars. Multi-decadal, longitudinal studies of sediment transport dynamics within this context are very rare, and most prior work has focussed on the impacts of relatively short-lived sediment supply events. For the last century, the Samala River, Guatemala, has received a persistent supply of sediment due to the long-lived and ongoing development of the Santiaguito lava dome complex. This case presents an exceptional opportunity to examine the relationship between persistent but variable sediment supply, water supply, and subsequent fluvial adjustment over a multi-decadal time span. Thus, here, we present a ~40-year synthesis of remotely sensed lava extrusion rates, river aggradation rates, and rainfall, complemented by available ground-based observations.
