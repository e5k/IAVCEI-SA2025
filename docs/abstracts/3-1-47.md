:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

We present Orange-Volcanoes, an extension (add-on) of the open-source platform Orange Data Mining, specifically designed to advance data-driven analysis in petrology, geochemistry, and volcanology. Orange-Volcanoes expands the core capabilities of Orange by integrating tools for: (i) Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA), (ii) cleaning and preprocessing of geochemical and petrological data, and (iii) mineral and liquid thermobarometry.
The combination of these tools enables the rapid application of machine learning, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling to large petro-volcanological datasets, supporting visual and interactive data exploration. The platform's visual programming environment fosters collaborative research, ensuring reproducibility and accessibility for scientists, educators, and students without requiring programming skills.
The ability to apply diverse statistical and machine learning tools to geochemical data, while interactively visualizing step-by-step results, makes Orange and Orange-Volcanoes valuable assets for managing large multivariate datasets and supporting petrological volcano monitoring.
The ability to apply explainable artificial intelligence techniques, such as feature importance and Shapley additive explanations, allows users to better interpret the underlying drivers of geochemical variability, enhancing understanding of magmatic processes.
Through case studies, we demonstrate the application of Orange-Volcanoes in clustering geochemical data and conducting petrological assessments. As the volume of geochemical, petrological, and volcanological data grows, this tool facilitates the future integration of data mining and machine learning techniques into scientists' workflows. Orange-Volcanoes represents a significant step toward a transparent, reproducible, and collaborative scientific approach.
