Volcanic eruptions pose significant societal and environmental hazards, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of magma dynamics. This study integrates petrological and experimental methodologies to characterize volcanic processes and potentially aid in reducing volcanic risk. Petrology can provide insights into magma composition, temperature, crystallization, and volatile behavior, while analogue modelling replicates magma transport and eruptive phenomena on observable scales. By combining these approaches, this study bridges the gap between laboratory experiments and natural systems, advancing the understanding of magma feeding systems, conduit processes, and eruption mechanisms. Key research focuses include magma ascent dynamics, dike propagation, and potential shifts in eruption dynamics. The current work for this study is comparing crystal populations in dykes with analogue experiments. These experiments use petrological inputs---e.g. mineral chemistry, melt inclusions, and crystallinity---to constrain parameters like viscosity, density, and volatile content in scaled analogue materials. Preliminary results can reveal insights into magma mixing, degassing, and fragmentation, linking physical processes to petrological features like zoned crystals and volatile gradients. Crystal population dynamics in analogue models and conduit models will also be used to assess the representativeness of diffusion timescales from fast diffusing elements (e.g. H+ in olivine). Future investigations may target the Lamongan volcanic field in East Java, Indonesia. Volatile analyses and studies of lava dome sizes in relation to eruptive styles further enhance the collective understanding of magma dynamics. This integrated approach offers novel perspectives on volcanic systems, which can support eruption forecasting, hazard assessment, and predictive model development for diverse volcanic settings.
