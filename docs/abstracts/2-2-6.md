:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

SANTORY is a state-of-the-art project aiming at submarine volcanic hazard monitoring in the Aegean Sea. Focused on Kolumbo submarine volcano NE of Santorini Island, this cutting-edge observatory combines advanced imaging, physical and chemical measurements, and real-time monitoring technologies to address one of the region's most significant volcanic threats. 
Over the past two years, SANTORY has provided unprecedented insights into Kolumbo's geological dynamics and volcanic activity. High-resolution 3D mapping revealed steep slopes, mass-wasting deposits, and hydrothermal vent fields, critical for assessing seafloor instability and potential eruption risks. Novel hyperspectral imaging and autonomous video systems have captured vent activity, bubbling plumes, and environmental changes, providing the most complete assessment of hydrothermal processes to date, and establishing a baseline for potential tracking of underlying volcanic processes.
Autonomous sensors deployed on the crater floor have been monitoring hydrothermal outflow temperature, pressure, and chemistry of fluids; these parameters will help quantify chemical fluxes, and reveal periodic variations driven by tides, in addition to magmatic activity. Datasets revealing these hydrothermal fluctuations may thus be critical in detecting precursors signals of volcanic unrest. Chemical and isotopic analyses confirmed the degassing of CO~2~-rich hydrothermal fluids with a mantle-like ^3^He/^4^He signature, reinforcing Kolumbo's potential for hazardous eruptions. 
SANTORY constitues an initiative for developing a protocol for volcanic hazard mitigation that can be extrapolated to other systems. By integrating cutting-edge technologies and multidisciplinary expertise, the project delivers actionable insights to improve early warning systems and protect vulnerable coastal communities. SANTORY sets a new benchmark in safeguarding against submarine volcanic threats.
