:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

In recent years, initiatives have flourished in the Arequipa region (Peru) to promote volcanic risk education through the valorization of geoheritage and cultural heritage. These include: a guided geotourist route and quarry that the *maestro canteros* transformed into a field of sculptures, allowing tourism to support the survival of traditional stone sculpture activities; the recognition of this area as one of the IUGS's first 100 geosites; a short animated film depicting the formation of the Sillar, an ignimbrite deposit formed 1.65 million years ago; a book with the same characters explaining volcanic hazards; an open-access interactive map composed of 360-degree images where locals and scientists describe their environment; exhibitions displaying volcanic tephra deposits in slabs from Misti volcano at the San Agustin University and the Civil Protection Awareness Center in Arequipa; an (audio-)book in Quechua for the Colca and Andagua Volcanoes UNESCO Global Geopark.
At first glance, these initiatives may seem unrelated to each other, but they are, in fact, directly connected to at least one other initiative, and sometimes to all of them. We will establish these connections and explain how they enhance the potential for risk awareness, particularly in the city of Arequipa, where over one million inhabitants are directly exposed to the effects of extreme rain events and a potential eruption of the Misti volcano.
