The Campi Flegrei caldera in southern Italy is currently experiencing a prolonged period of intense unrest, characterised by significant degassing, rapid ground uplift, and increased seismicity. This activity is monitored using various methods, including seismic, gravimetric, ground deformation, geochemical and thermal analyses. However, electromagnetic monitoring within the caldera is lacking, despite its ability to provide a powerful means of investigating active volcanic areas by correlating electromagnetic variations with underlying hydrothermal and magmatic processes. These processes significantly affect the electromagnetic field, with fluctuations often reflecting changes in subsurface dynamics that can be measured and interpreted as related to magma movement and/or fluid circulation. Consequently, electromagnetic field monitoring is a critical tool for detecting and interpreting these variations, particularly during unrest phases, when rapid and significant shifts in volcanic behaviour require detailed analysis to enhance hazard assessment and early warning capabilities. In this study, we present a combination of continuous recording of natural electromagnetic signals with additional time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography performed in specific sectors of the caldera most involved in the geophysical and geochemical variations associated with the current unrest. These combined methods could provide new insights into the internal dynamics of the caldera, improving our ability to characterize and assess the ongoing volcanic activity of this complex volcanic system.
