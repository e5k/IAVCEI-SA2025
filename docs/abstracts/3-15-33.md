:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The Facility for Open Research in a Compressed Environment (FORCE) is a new research laboratory at Arizona State University where the volcanology community can access a newly designed, state-of-the-art internally heated pressure vessel (IHPV) designed by Wille Geotechnik. "Nebula" will provide large volume capabilities to pressures of 600 MPa up to 1250 °C for experiments relevant to the volcanological community, including studies of magma storage conditions and volatile solubility.
 
FORCE also provides  large volume, high pressure devices previously only accessible outside of the United States. These apparatuses can be used to investigate conditions equivalent to depths up to Earth's mid-mantle. The 500 ton high pressure torsional press "Twister" provides high pressure shear deformation at up to 6 GPa and 200°C. The 6000 ton Kawai-type multi-anvil press "Ichiban" allows for synthesis of ultra-large volume samples up to 25 GPa and T up to 2000 °C. The 1500 ton DIA cubic press "Jasmine" will provide pressures from 25 GPa up to perhaps 80 GPa and up to 2000 °C.
