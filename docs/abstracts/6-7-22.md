Volcanic eruptions are among the most complex natural phenomena as they can produce multiple hazards, often causing spatio-temporal overlapping impacts. With increasing exposure in volcanic areas, comprehensive risk assessments are key to reduce the consequences of eruptions. Assessing the risk to road networks is crucial both to short-term and long-term risk management to facilitate access to key infrastructure and evacuation of inhabitants, as well as to improve land-use and development plans. This work attempts to combine multiple hazards (i.e., tephra fallout and volcanic ballistic projectiles) to estimate the potential risk on the road network of Vulcano Island (Italy) using the ADVISE methodology. In order to homogenise the hazards effects, a four-level hazard scale is proposed, taking into account not only physical but also functional impacts. The highest level of multi-hazard risk is associated with the road connecting the north (Porto) and the west (Lentia) of the island, as well as the first part of the road connecting to the south port (Gelso). These results are especially important given the lack of redundancy of the road network of Vulcano island and the key role that these two road segments play in case of evacuation.
