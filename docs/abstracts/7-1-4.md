:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Cities often contain volcanic geoheritage that is important for urban sustainability and social well-being created through scientific research, geoeducation, recreation, esthetics, and nature conservation. Mexico City was founded in a beautiful setting: a shallow lake basin surrounded by snow-capped volcanoes. However, uncontrolled hyperurbanization has caused the loss of most natural spaces, to such an extent that city residents are poorly aware of both the risks and benefits associated with their volcanic environment. Young monogenetic volcanoes in the southern part of the city provide the last remnants of the original landscape and preserve part of the native flora and fauna of the basin. However, the population and the authorities ignore their value so that they do not get involved in their protection and upkeep, and this threatens their survival.
I will present here the first results of the *Geocity Project *(CONAHCYT CBF-1049) that aims to form a network of geosites in the city, through providing academic support to existing efforts of conservation led by citizens or local authorities, hence building bridges within the local community. We apply methods from geology, biology and geography to determine the scientific value of these sites and identify the elements that threaten them. We also integrate perspectives from social sciences and humanities (archaeology, politics, economy, anthropology and geo-esthetics) to understand the interactions between urban communities and their environment in the past and the present. Finally, we co-create solutions for the restoration and long-term conservation of these sites by sharing knowledge across the academia and civils.
