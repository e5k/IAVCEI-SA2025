Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has served as a reliable research tool for studying volcanic unrest and eruptions worldwide for over two decades. Its operational use as a geodetic monitoring tool at volcano observatories, however, has often been limited by high data latency and challenges in rapid data processing. The U.S. Geological Survey Volcano Science Center (USGS-VSC) is developing an automated InSAR processing system for near-real-time monitoring, leveraging low-latency SAR data from current and future satellite missions (e.g., Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMed, RADARSAT-2, NISAR). This system autonomously retrieves newly acquired data from international space agencies, often within two hours of acquisition. It processes these data into accessible products and distributes them through an interactive visualization platform to experts at various USGS observatories. This capability also supports the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program in responding to volcanic events outside the United States.
In this presentation, we will detail the rationale behind the USGS-VSC InSAR processing system and demonstrate its operational application through recent events at Kīlauea, Hawaiʻi. Notable examples include the Southwest Rift Zone dike intrusion and eruption in January--February and June 2024, respectively, along with multiple dike intrusions in the East Rift Zone that culminated in an eruption in September 2024.
While challenges remain in applying InSAR to some volcanoes in the United States, primarily due to heavy vegetation and seasonal snow cover, new data analysis algorithms are being explored to maximize data coverage and improve monitoring capabilities at all USGS volcano observatories.
