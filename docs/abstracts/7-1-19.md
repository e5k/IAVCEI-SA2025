^Tenerife´s volcanism as a result of the accumulation of different volcanic materials during the last 16 million years. This complex volcanism creates spectacular landscapes that contain great diversity of volcanic (stratovolcanoes, calderas, shield volcanoes, domes, cinder or scoria cones, hornitos, maars, tuff ring and cones, lava fields, lava delta, volcanic tubes and others minor volcanic landforms) and non-volcanic geoforms associated with erosion and accumulation processes (cliffs, ravines, beaches, dunes, periglaciarism and others). The main aim of this work is to identify the diversity of the geoheritage of Tenerife in order to propose geoconservation strategies and promote geotourism to diversify the island's leisure offerings. In Tenerife it can be recognized different morphostructures: three shield volcanoes (Anaga, Teno and Adeje), two volcanic ridges (Pedro Gil and Abeque), an important volcanic field in the south of the island, a central caldera (Las Cañadas), a complex stratovolcano (Teide-Pico Viejo) and hundreds of cinder or scoria monogenetic cones scattered throughout the island's geography. All of this results in a rich and varied geoheritage that can contribute to strengthening geotourism in Tenerife. To achieve this, it is first necessary to identify the geoheritage and then propose strategies for geoconservation and the promotion of geotourism through georoutes. Finally, the inventory of volcanic and non-volcanic geoforms, the proposal for geoconservation within the natural protected areas, and the establishment of geo-itineraries in both natural and urban spaces will be able to diversify the sun and beach tourism offer in Tenerife.^
