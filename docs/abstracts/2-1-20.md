:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

At the basaltic calderas of the western Galápagos Islands, large intra-caldera earthquakes have been commonly observed closely preceding eruption onset. The nature of earthquake-eruption interaction likely plays a role in eruption initiation, yet the specific mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we analyze microseismicity to show that the initiation of the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra involved a complex cascading process lasting over ten hours. The co-seismic stress changes from a Mw 5.4 trapdoor faulting earthquake did not immediately promote failure of the magma reservoir, as happened for the 2005 eruption. Instead, the emergence of repeating long-period earthquakes (LPs) families indicates a cryptic phase of reservoir failure, ultimately culminating in dyke propagation and eruption. Our results indicate that a primed magmatic system and favorable co-seismic stress changes may not be sufficient to cause reservoir failure and suggest that such eruptions can be harder to forecast than currently thought.
