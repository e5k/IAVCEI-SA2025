:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Aviation and the atmosphere are deeply interconnected, making a solid understanding of meteorological processes vital to passenger safety. However, several atmospheric factors remain significant challenges for aviation operations, including severe weather, space weather, and natural airborne hazards. This study specifically examines the effects of volcanic eruptions on aviation, focusing on the dispersion of volcanic SO~2~ in the atmosphere.
After highlighting the potential damage to aircraft caused by flying through volcanic plumes (from SO~2~-rich eruptions, continuous degassing, or anthropogenic sources), this work aims to enhance the quality of SO~2~ cloud data provided to the aviation community using artificial intelligence (AI). Our system develops its algorithms by incorporating both historical data (spanning several months) and near-real-time data inputs (delivered within 10 minutes to 3 hours). Leveraging advanced SO~2~ observations from geostationary (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite sensors operating in the ultraviolet and infrared spectral ranges, the KAIROS system seeks to offer aviation stakeholders precise digital SO~2~ forecasts with longer lead times. These forecasts will be compatible with decision-support tools, enabling stakeholders to mitigate the impacts of volcanic clouds on their operations. By providing accurate AI-based SO~2~ forecasts earlier in the air traffic flow management process, aviation stakeholders will be better equipped to minimize operational disruptions. Forecasting SO~2~ transport around volcanoes is crucial for reducing population health risk and benefiting civil protection and government agencies.
