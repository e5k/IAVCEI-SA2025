Geothermal energy is considered a key future energy source due to its widespread availability, stability, safety, and low carbon emissions. High-temperature geothermal resources (above 150ÂºC) are mainly found at plate boundaries, often linked with magmatic activity, while intraplate regions, especially densely populated areas, typically have fewer high-temperature geothermal resources. In the
In the Northeast China, Cenozoic basalt is common, with intraplate magmatic rocks around the Songliao Basin and surrounding NE-NNE rift systems. Volcanic activity since the Quaternary also surrounds the basin. This study simulates magmatic activity and finds that the crust's thermal structure significantly influences magma emplacement. A cold, rigid crust hinders magma ascent, while a warm, softening crust allows magma to erupt. An optimal Moho temperature supports prolonged magma residence
In the Songliao Basin, the Moho temperature is intermediate, suggesting the potential presence of concealed magma chambers. The paper proposes a model identifying "sweet spots" for intraplate basaltic geothermal resources, where magma chambers might exist below the surface, even without volcanic activity. This research improves understanding of magma intrusion patterns and supports global exploration of concealed high-temperature geothermal resources. Preliminary global Moho temperature calculations can aid in identifying thermal anomaly
