:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

This study investigates the application of seismic cross-entropy as a possible geophysical precursor of volcanic activity in the Canary Islands, with a special focus on the 2021 Tajogaite eruption (La Palma, Spain). Using data from the Red Sísmica Canaria, which comprised seven seismic stations operational during the eruption period, we calculated temporal variation in seismic entropy for each station and seismic cross-entropy for all possible station pairs. The results show a significant and widespread decline in cross-entropy in the hours preceding the eruption. Additionally, we performed a spatiotemporal analysis using two-dimensional Gaussian interpolation. This allowed us to create cross-entropy maps, revealing that the minimum cross-entropy values were concentrated precisely in the area where the eruption occurred.
These results suggest that cross-entropy can be a valuable indicator for the early detection of volcanic eruptions, providing an additional tool for volcanic monitoring and risk mitigation. This tool has computation times low enough to be implemented in real-time. We maintain that this study highlights the importance of cross-entropy in seismo-volcanic monitoring and its potential application in other volcanic contexts.
