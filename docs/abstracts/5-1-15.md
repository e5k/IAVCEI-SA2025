Pantelleria Island, in Southern Italy, has significant potential for geothermal energy development due to its high geothermal gradient (>150 °C/km), active CO~2~ emissions, and evidence of past volcanic resurgence. This study seeks to advance the understanding of the island's geothermal system through high-resolution gravity modeling.
A comprehensive gravity survey was conducted, integrating existing on-land datasets with 130 newly acquired stations and offshore gravity data extending up to 30 km from the coast, resulting in a dataset of 1,050 measurement points. The combined data enabled the production of Free-Air and Bouguer anomaly maps with a spatial resolution of approximately 3 stations per km². These maps revealed significant horizontal density variations, correlated with subsurface geological structures.
Edge analysis techniques, such as the Total Horizontal Derivative (THD), were applied to detect horizontal density contrasts, highlighting key stratigraphic and structural boundaries. These findings provided essential input for gravity data inversion, enabling the construction of a detailed 3D gravity model. The inversion process incorporates prior geological knowledge derived from borehole data, interpretations of reflection seismic data and a 3D resistivity model derived from magnetotelluric surveys.
This multidisciplinary approach provides new insights into Pantelleria's geothermal system and highlights the island's potential for sustainable energy development. The results underscore the importance of integrated geophysical methods in geothermal resource assessment, contributing to the advancement of renewable energy applications.
