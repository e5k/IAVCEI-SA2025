The sustainable development of the outermost regions, where adverse meteorological factors, whether or not enhanced by climate change, are at the origin of environmental imbalances in ecosystems and natural disasters, requires a set of sophisticated analysis of the surrounding processes to understand, analyze and mitigate them. The geomorphological evolution of volcanic islands is determined by geomorphological processes, in particular slope movements, which represent a serious constraint for human activity and ecosystems. Moreover, they constitute a considerable source of risk for people and property, and it is therefore crucial to strengthen their knowledge and to increase resilience and adaptive capacity to this climate-related risk. The main objective of PRISMAC project is to analyze, mitigate and manage natural hazards, particularly the risk of slope movements enhanced by climate change in oceanic volcanic islands in the Macaronesia region. The objective of the project is to develop and harmonize methodologies to analyze susceptibility and risk to slope movements with a view to identifying risk sites for the development of slope movement monitoring, warning and alarm systems, at local and regional scales, for each of the regions.
