Stratovolcanoes show a wide range of eruptive rates and behaviours, potentially reflecting differences in magmatic systems architecture and history, moderated by tectonic factors. However, on a case-by-case basis, the influence of such parameters remains poorly understood. To address this challenge, we conduct a comparative petrological study of two stratovolcanoes showing different eruptive rates and chemistry of erupted products: Pico de Orizaba and Nevado de Toluca, located in the subduction-related Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB).
Pico de Orizaba stratovolcano, situated at the eastern margin of the TMVB at a trench-normal distance of about 390 km, has been active since the Pleistocene (650 Ka) and likely last erupted in the 16^th^ century. Over its four main volcanic stages (Torrecillas, Espolón de Oro, so-called Outer Domes and Citlaltépetl), it has erupted a range of basaltic andesite to rhyolite compositions, alternating over time between higher and lower silica content lava.
In contrast, Nevado de Toluca, located in the central part of the TMVB at a trench-normal distance of about 300 km, is a long-lived compositionally monotonous stratovolcano, that has predominantly produced dacites and minor andesites since 1.5 Ma, with its last eruption dated at around 3 Ka.
We used optical microscopy, Electron Probe Microanalyzer, X-ray Fluorescence and machine learning based thermobarometry and chemometry on newly acquired samples from these two contrasting volcanoes, to trace the parameters influencing their magma generation and the temporal evolution of their volcanic plumbing system architectures.
