It is increasingly recognised that a holistic approach to volcanic geoheritage that considers the interconnectedness of tangible and intangible natural (geological, geomorphological, ecological) and cultural (e.g., aesthetic, recreational, traditional, historic, social and spiritual) elements is key for the success of geotourism and geoconservation. This study presents a geosystem services approach to document and explore the multiple values of volcanic geoheritage in Newer Volcanics Province of Australia, with a focus on its under researched tangible and intangible cultural geoheritage values. This research presents a holistic narrative that fosters a deep appreciation of the intricate links between Earth systems and human culture. The inclusion of cultural values in geoheritage frameworks, contributes to raising awareness of the broader significance of volcanic geoheritage, enhancing its appeal to visitors in urban to rural areas. Furthermore, it provides opportunities for multidisciplinary and multicultural dialogue, enhances geoeducation, and supports culturally aware geoconservation.
