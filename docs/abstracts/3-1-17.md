The Ediacaran Saghro Massif, in the eastern Anti-Atlas of Morocco, hosts extensive dyke swarms that intrude formations of the Saghro Group and the Ouarzazate Supergroup. This study investigates a dyke swarm in the central part of the massif to constrain the depth of the magma chamber source and the tectonic regime active during emplacement.
A total of seventy-eight dykes were analyzed in terms of orientation, thickness, length, and geometric characteristics. The depth of the magma chamber was estimated by evaluating dyke aspect ratios and magma overpressure, incorporating parameters such as the elastic properties and density of the host rock, magma density, gravitational acceleration, and Poisson's ratio. Additionally, paleo-stress analysis was conducted to reconstruct the prevailing tectonic conditions.
The findings suggest that these dykes originated from a deep-seated magma reservoir, likely near the Moho discontinuity. Paleo-stress reconstruction indicates that their emplacement occurred under a transtensive tectonic regime linked to the WACadomian orogeny.
