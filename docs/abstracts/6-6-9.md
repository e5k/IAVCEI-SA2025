Active volcanoes emit metals such as mercury with potentially negative/harmful impacts on the health of communities living in proximity. Our work aimed to determine: a) the level of accumulation and distribution of mercury in the environment close to the emission source (up to 13 km), and b) its temporal storage in bioaccumulators. We have investigated the nature of mercury at the end of 2020--2022 eruptive activity and prior to the new eruptive cycle starting on July 4th, 2024 of Mt Etna (Italy), which is the largest volcano in Europe with >1M people living in its shadow, and one of the greatest emitters of mercury in the world. We conducted laboratory analysis of total mercury and methylmercury concentrations in chestnut leaves, insects (ladybugs and ground beetles), and soils (from tephra-devoid surface down to ~20-cm depth), which are putative prime accumulators of mercury in the environment, at elevations ranging from 720 to 2867 m a.s.l. and at distances from the Southeast Crater volcanic vent ranging from 0.9 to 12.5 km away. Our data showed that mercury accumulated most in the first ~5 cm-deep soil (2 to 36 ng/g) and in ground beetles (10 to 156 ng/g, which is 2 to 60 times higher than that of ladybugs). Their main distribution follows the eastward / southeastward dispersion of gas and tephra from paroxysms at Mt Etna. We plan to correlate mercury accumulation and dispersion with soil mineralogy, organic concentration, eruption intensity and quiescence.
