:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The internal dynamics of pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) cannot be directly observed and much of our understanding of their complex physics is inferred from analysis of the deposits they leave behind. Data obtained directly from PDC deposits, such as grain size distributions and particle density, are key input parameters for numerical simulations of PDCs, and estimates of hazard impact metrics, used for hazard assessments. Comparison of numerical and analogue model outputs with field observations from natural PDC deposits can be used to validate the extent to which these models realistically simulate natural PDCs. However, our ability to compare and collate field datasets for integration with numerical and analogue models is limited by a lack of a publicly available database of PDC deposit characteristics.
We present a global database of PDC deposit characteristics incorporating quantitative data (e.g., grain size, particle density, bedform dimensions) and qualitative descriptions of deposit appearance (e.g., sedimentary structures, lithofacies). The database includes data from 78 source publications, covering 97 eruptions, and 214 depositional units, from 55 volcanoes across 6 continents. Eruptions recorded in the database vary from VEI 1-8 and have magma bulk compositions ranging from trachybasalt to rhyolite.
The database can be used for a variety of applications, including i) comparison of single deposit case studies to global datasets, ii) informing numerical and analogue model input parameters, iii) validation of numerical and analogue models against a wide variety of natural deposits, iv) calculating hazard impact metrics of PDCs from past eruptions to inform hazard assessments.
