:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Emissions of CO~2~ from magmatic arcs can affect the atmosphere composition, thereby driving long-term global climate changes. Early Cenozoic climate trends are generally associated with changes in global silicate weathering related to Neo-Tethyan geodynamics, but the likely climatic effects of changes in degassing from Neo-Tethyan magmatic arcs have been poorly quantified. Here, we provide the first measures of the volatile content (CO~2~, H~2~O, F, Cl and S) of pre-eruptive melts based on glassy, bubble-bearing and reheated melt inclusions within plagioclase and clinopyroxene crystals in Early Cenozoic trachyandesites from the Alborz and Tabriz regions (Iran). CO~2~ concentrations in these melt inclusions reach up to 6733 ppm, thus providing a minimum estimate of the total amount of CO~2~ released from the Iran magmas during the middle-late Eocene of 1.01.10^19^ g CO~2~, with a total C flux released from those magmas of 0.306 (± 0.123) Mt C/yr. Our findings support earlier hypotheses that magmatic CO~2~ degassing from the target igneous provinces played a role in the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum. Therefore, additional measurements of the volatile contents of Neo-Tethyan magmas are essential to assess the drivers of Early Cenozoic climate trends and to understand the global cycling of volatiles over geological timescales.
