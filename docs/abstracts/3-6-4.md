:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Eruptive dynamics of silicic volcanoes is highly related to the possibility for gases to escape or not from the magmatic column. However, understanding and quantifying how and when this gas phase exsolves from the melt, expands and finds its way toward the surface, possibly independently from the melt, is not an easy task since it involves complex physical interactions between volatiles, melt and crystals. In order to improve our understanding of these complex mechanisms, especially during the pre-eruptive periods, we will consider evidences coming from naturals samples, numerical results as well as experimental data to highlight the role of high amount of crystals on gas content within volcanic conduits prior to eruption.
