Mechanical failure is ubiquitous to any geological process in the Earth's crust and thus occurs at a wide range of deformation rates. Most studies looking at how rocks fail in tension are limited to a small strain rate range (e.g., 10^-5^ 10^-3^ s^-1^). Here we selected 3 rocks with varying porosities (ca., 2 -- 25%) from which we prepared 38x19 mm Brazil discs. We use a uniaxial press and a drop tower to characterise the tensile strength of volcanic rocks at strain rates from 10^-5^ to 10^3^ s^-1^. While the uniaxial press can bring the sample to failure at constant rates of 10^-5^ -- 10^0^ s^-1^, we estimate the strain rate in the drop tower by dropping an impactor, with an added mass ranging from 0 -- 30 kg, from different heights. We evaluate our results considering current empirical laws that aim at estimating the tensile strength of rocks as a function of porosity.
