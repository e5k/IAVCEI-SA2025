:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

As part of the geochemical monitoring of Teide volcano, the only active stratovolcano in Tenerife (Canary Islands), during the last three decades the volcano has been the subject of a geochemical monitoring of the fumarole discharges, characterized by low flux emission of fluids with temperatures of ∼83°C, located at the Teide summit crater. The temporal variations in fumarole gas chemistry at Teide volcano was useful to detect significant changes in the chemical composition of the Teide fumarole one year before a seismic crisis that occurred in Tenerife Island between April and June 2004, suggesting that associated temporal changes in seismic activity and magmatic degassing indicate that geophysical and fluid geochemistry signals in this system are unequivocally related. The average of the air-corrected 3He/4He ratio during the period 1991-2024 was 7.03 RA (being RA the atmospheric ratio), with the maximum value of the time series (7.57 RA) measured in August 2016, when an input of magmatic fluids triggered by an injection of fresh magma and convective mixing took place beneath Teide volcano. After 2016, the observed changes in the fumarole gas chemistry of Teide volcano suggest a certain disequilibrium in the volcano-hydrothermal system of Teide due to sustained heat pulses, likely caused by the input of magmatic fluids. This work highlights the important role of volcanic gases in the monitoring of volcanic activity, paying attention to different chemical and isotopic species in the fumarolic discharges.
