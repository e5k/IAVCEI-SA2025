:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The paradigm of open data has transformed numerous scientific fields, enabling unprecedented collaboration, innovation, and societal impact. We have already learned from successful historical projects where open data had a groundbreaking impact.  The Human Genome Project is a testament to how open data sharing can catalyze advancements across disciplines and the International Seismological Centre's global earthquake catalog revolutionized seismic research and monitoring. Openness fosters interdisciplinary insights and accelerates solutions to global challenges.
However, the path to fully open data in volcanology is fraught with obstacles. Institutional resistance, lack of standardization, and concerns about intellectual property rights persist as barriers to achieving FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data practices. We need actionable strategies to overcome these hurdles, emphasizing the importance of establishing community-driven standards, incentivizing data sharing, and leveraging technological advances for secure and transparent data exchange.
By addressing challenges head-on, learning from historical successes, and championing new paradigms, the volcanology community can harness the full potential of open data, driving scientific progress and enhancing societal resilience against volcanic hazards.
The transformative potential of open data is greater than it has ever been.
