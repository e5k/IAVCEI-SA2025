Volcano deformation monitoring is crucial for understanding magmatic processes and assessing volcanic hazards. Satellite systems such as Sentinel-1 provide regular, global, and open-access data, enabling continuous observations even in remote or hazardous areas. Automated and open-source processing systems, such as LiCSAR/LiCSBAS (https://comet.nerc.ac.uk/comet-volcano-portal/), have revolutionized global volcano monitoring by providing efficient time-series deformation analysis using Sentinel-1 datasets. However, the time-series are currently produced using global default parameters, causing issues with data gaps and low coherence, which influence the accuracy and reliability of the time-series inversion, particularly in regions affected by seasonal decorrelation or sparse data coverage.
To address these limitations, we refine the LiCSAR and LiCSBAS workflows to adapt to local conditions. Specifically, we integrate long-term baseline interferograms and use coherence statistics to generate high-quality interferograms, improving the temporal coverage and reliability of InSAR time-series networks. To test this strategy, we analyzed 14 volcanoes selected based on their geographic location (across continents and latitudes), snow cover, vegetation cover, and other factors affecting InSAR coherence. The study aims to demonstrate that incorporating coherence-optimized long-term baseline interferograms can improve the continuity and accuracy of deformation measurements, offering a more complete picture of global volcanic deformation dynamics.
These refinements to LiCSAR and LiCSBAS workflows can significantly advance global volcano monitoring capabilities, ensuring that InSAR remains a cornerstone technique in volcanology. This work lays a foundation for more reliable and comprehensive monitoring systems, addressing both scientific needs and societal priorities in managing volcanic risks.
