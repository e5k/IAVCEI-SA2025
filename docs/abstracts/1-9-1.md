:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The crystallisation and dissolution of minerals plays a crucial role in the petrogenesis of igneous rocks, particularly under magmatic storage conditions, where the formation of crystal mush may occur, and within conduits during magma ascent. Disequilibrium textures in crystals, such as complex zoning, can result from rapid crystal growth, resorption, and diffusive re-equilibration. These textures reflect transitions between subliquidus and superheated conditions. Superheating, where the temperature exceeds the liquidus of crystal phases, can occur following the injection of hot, fresh magma into a storage region or via magma heating from decompression-driven crystallisation.
Crystallization and mineral dissolution significantly influence the mobility and eruptibility of basaltic magmas, which, in turn, impacts volcanic risk assessments and mitigation strategies in active volcanic regions. However, the relationships between crystallinity, magma rheology, and eruptibility remain uncertain, largely due to the challenges associated with documenting these processes in real time.
While crystallisation kinetics have been extensively studied through *ex situ* quench experiments, recent advances now allow for *in situ*, real-time investigation. Here, we present the results of three-dimensional, time-dependent (4D) high-temperature experiments conducted under water-saturated conditions using synchrotron X-ray microtomography. These innovative 4D experiments simulate crustal pressures and provide unique, quantitative insights into the crystallisation and dissolution kinetics of pyroxene in basaltic magmas, examining their behaviour as a function of time, undercooling, and superheating.
