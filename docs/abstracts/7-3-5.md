:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

This poster will discuss results from the IMAGINE project, which has examined scientific and societal understandings of volcanoes in parts of Latin America. Working with communities, museums and volcano observatories, the project sought to understand the different kinds of knowledge and experiences of people living on volcanoes, recognising that "risk" as an idea may be imposed from the outside. The geohistory of these communities is a significant part of their identity in a range of different ways, but they do not necessarily view volcanoes as a "risk" at all. Communities include indigenous groups as well as settlers and more recent arrivals linked to new industries including geotourism and geoparks. The project sought to be collaborative and equitable in its approach, allowing communities and collaborators to define the most important goals and outcomes.
