Volcano monitoring relies on a multifaceted approach, with seismic and deformation networks playing critical roles in detecting early signs of volcanic unrest. Seismic monitoring captures ground vibrations, and deformation networks track surface changes, both could be linked to volcanic activity. Together, they provide essential data for understanding volcanic systems and forecasting eruptions. Complementing these efforts, data transmission networks ensure real-time transmission of critical information, enabling effective early warning and disaster preparedness. However, continuous real-time monitoring is challenging due to environmental conditions and the risk of instrumental loss due to volcanic activity. Using Marapi volcano, Sumatra, as example, this study explores optimizing data transmission by analyzing reliability and redundancy. Results show that removing stations near observatory reduces reliability and redundancy scores, while removing distant stations obscured by terrain improves these metrics. Placing new stations near observatory and at higher elevations enhances performance. The findings emphasize that station positioning relative to observatory improves transmission reliability and redundancy, ensuring effective real-time monitoring. Stations behind the volcano degrade performance, making their removal beneficial without significantly affecting the network's functionality. This work is limited to data transmission and does not address the stations' ability to detect volcanic unrest, such as deformation and seismic activity. To integrate data and physical modeling to better understand volcanic systems, reliable data transmission is essential, as it ensures timely availability of critical information for analysis. Future research will focus on optimizing seismic and deformation monitoring networks, ultimately integrating all three into a cohesive framework to enhance volcano monitoring and preparedness.Â
