:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The Volcano Observations Thematic Core Service (VOLC-TCS) is one of ten core services forming the European Plate Observing System (EPOS). The objective of the VOLC-TCS is the implementation of a technical, financial, and legal framework to (i) strengthen the European volcanology community and (ii) provide virtual access to the community's data, data products software and services from volcanoes in Europe and European overseas territories. The efforts of the VOLC-TCS began prior to the appointment of EPOS as an ERIC and have followed a long-term work plan that started in 2002. The main challenges have consisted in (1) data heterogeneity regarding technical and legal aspects (e.g. different data policies among the data providers, different purposes for the use of data), (2) the consistency of the VOLC-TCS' products with the overall service provision of EPOS, which merges services from different Earth Science communities, (3) the harmonisation of the data and products with standards defined by other TCSs, and (4) the implementation of the community Gateway to expose and enable access to services not fully EPOS compliant or to services implemented by institutions outside the EPOS, and to create a platform acting as an interface between the VOLC-TCS and data infrastructures operating at a global level (e.g. WOVOdat). Based on the experience gained and the results achieved, we report on the state of the art of the VOLC-TCS since 2018 and propose future actions to address some of the main technical challenges and measures to ensure mid-to-long term sustainability of the services.
