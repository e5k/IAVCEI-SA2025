Ground-based remote sensing systems have become important tools for the monitoring of volcanic activity. They provide safe, real-time, continuous and reliable measurements with a high spatial and temporal resolution.
This work presents a cross-comparison between simultaneous UV and TIR SO~2~ emission rate measurements from ground-based systems carried out in a dedicated field campaign organized at Popocatépetl volcano (Mexico) in February 2024. The systems used are:
(1) three high-performance dual UV imaging systems with synchronous acquisition of images and integrated spectrometer;
(2) a UV MaxDoas Novac scanning spectrometer;
(3) a new portable and low-cost TIR system consisting of two cameras, a broadband in the 8-14 μm window and an identical one with a narrowband filter centered at 8.7 μm in front. In particular, for this system, a correction procedure for the particles present in the plume (ash, water vapor particles, etc ...) has been developed in order to avoid their high contribution at 8.7 μm and therefore to improve the reliability of the SO~2~ retrievals.
Finally, the SO~2~ emission rates time series obtained from the different ground based systems were cross-compared with each other and with the flux retrieved by the TROPOMI instrument on board the S5p satellite.
This comparison allows to better understand the relationship between SO~2~ retrievals from UV and TIR systems, their strengths and weaknesses and the problems related to the comparison with satellite data.
