:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Formation of economically significant porphyry deposits requires vast amounts of magmatic volatiles (H~2~O, Cl, and S). However, the conditions enhancing efficient trans-crustal delivery of volatile fluxes remain unclear. In this work, we investigate the water contents of zircon and volatile compositions of zircon-hosted apatite of the co-sourced pre-ore (ca. 110 Ma), syn-ore (ca. 103Ma), and post-ore (ca. 97 Ma) intrusions in the Zijinshan porphyry-epithermal ore field (ZOF) in South China. Although geochemically similar, zircon-hosted apatite inclusions from the syn-ore porphyry yielded highly variable Cl (0.14-2.94 wt.%) and F (0.04-3.37 wt.%) contents, whereas the pre-ore and post-ore apatite populations show restricted halogen compositions (0.62-2.70 wt.% Cl, and 0.41-1.56 wt.% F). Numerical modeling of apatite evolutionary trends suggests that the syn-ore magma had the highest initial melt H~2~O (5.08 wt.%) and Cl (2035 ppm) contents, reaching volatile saturation at ~215MPa and exsolving fluids with a salinity of ~7.0 wt.% NaCl eq., consistent with zircon data. In comparison, pre-ore and post-ore magmas had lower initial H~2~O (3.6-3.9 wt. %) and Cl (890-1370 ppm) contents, saturating at ~80-166 MPa with less saline fluid (2.3-4.7 wt.% NaCl eq.). We suggest that the syn-ore saturated conditions optimize Cl-Cu extraction efficiency, promoting the formation of connected ore-fluid networks and fluxes that are favourable for porphyry mineralization. Given the lack of direct syn-ore mafic magma input, we propose that fluids derived from underplating mafic magmas serve as the dominant volatile accumulation mechanism for porphyry mineralization in the ZOF.
