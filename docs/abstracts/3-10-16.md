The Pisciarelli fumarole field in the Campi Flegrei caldera (Italy) is one of the most active hydrothermal systems, with high CO~2~ fluxes and significant seismicity. Since 2011, the area has experienced intense hydrothermal activity, including fumarole openings, groundwater level fluctuations in local springs, and mud emissions. Understanding the fluid dynamics and hazard potential of this system is essential for volcanic risk assessment. This study takes a comprehensive approach, integrating geophysical models and thermo-fluid dynamic numerical modelling to investigate the current state of the Pisciarelli hydrothermal system. We used high-resolution Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT), Time-Domain Induced Polarization (TDIP), and Self-Potential (SP) surveys to map subsurface structures such as fault systems and fracture zones, which are critical for understanding fluid migration pathways. Based on these data, we developed a conceptual model of the hydrothermal system and, thanks to constraints derived from various geological and geochemical literature studies, we performed numerical simulations using the TOUGH2 simulator and its EOS2 module, which models the fluid flow of an H~2~O-CO~2~ mixture through a porous medium. The simulations provided valuable insights into fluid ascent dynamics, highlighting the impact of permeability contrasts on fluid flows and their effect on pressure and temperature conditions within the system. The results also emphasized the role of fault systems in controlling fluid migration and surface degassing, clarifying the mechanisms responsible for the observed hydrothermal activity. This reconstruction improves our understanding of the system's fluid dynamics, paving the way for enhanced volcanic hazard forecasting and more effective monitoring strategies in the area.
