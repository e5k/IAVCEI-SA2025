:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Significant progress has been made, especially in the last 20 years, in the development of portable methods for remote sensing of volcanic gas emissions in the field. These tools help volcanologists to obtain, often in real-time, important information about the level and impact of volcanic activity, including plume composition, flux, location or speed. Some instruments measure the same variable but with different sensitivities, spatial or temporal resolution, while others may provide complementary information. Intercomparison between different methods is essential to ensure reproducibility of measurement results and to improve protocols and strategies for using complementary techniques.
We present the results of an intercomparison exercise conducted at Sabancaya Volcano (Peru) on 10-11 November 2022, during the 14^th^ Field Workshop of the IAVCEI Commission on the Chemistry of Volcanic Gases (CCVG). Measurements were taken by 12 groups with a variety of passive remote sensing techniques, using scattered light, solar occultation and thermal emission. Spectrometric and imaging equipment used non-dispersive, dispersive and interferometric techniques from the ultraviolet to thermal infrared regions.
The results of independent evaluations reveal SO~2~ fluxes between 22 and 45 kg/s, molar ratios of 10-22 for SO~2~/HCl and of 34-53 for SO~2~/HF 34-53. Results from coincident measurements using the same technique show relatively good agreement, while some discrepancies are observed between the results of different techniques. Possible causes of disagreement will be analysed, including natural variability for non-coincident measurements, varying choices of calculation parameters, different spectral evaluation settings, or physical effects caused by light extinction from air or ash.
