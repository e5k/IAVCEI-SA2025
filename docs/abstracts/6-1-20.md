Marine fallout ash beds can provide continuous, time-precise records of highly explosive arc volcanism that can be linked with the climate record. To investigate for causal links between climate evolution and volcanism during the past four million years, we compiled new and existing data of marine ash beds at ODP Sites 881, 882, and 884 to obtain a time-precise and temporally highly resolved record of the Plio-Pleistocene (0 to 4 Myr) Kamchatka-Kurile arc volcanism. The tephrostratigraphies confirm the cyclicity of the Kamchatka-Kurile arc volcanism and its marked increase at 2.73 Ma just after the intensification of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation. The stacked tephra record reveals periodic peaks in arc volcanicity at ~0.3, ~ 1.0, ~1.6, ~2.5, and ~3.8 Myr that coincide with maxima of the global ice volume variability that have been linked with the amplitude modulation of the precession (0.3, 1.0 Myr) and obliquity (1.6, 2.5 and 3.8 Myr) bands. A model of a decreasing obliquity variance across the mid-Pleistocene Transition at constant precession variance produces an excellent correlation of ash bed cycles with the variability of global benthic δ^18^O (r^2^ = 0.75). Collectively, the data imply external modulation of the Kamchatka-Kurile arc volcanism which is not direct orbital forcing but the climate-controlled periodic waxing and waning of the large ice shields that influence the frequency of mantle melting. However, the Kamchatka-Kurile arc volcanism may still influence climate by feedback.
