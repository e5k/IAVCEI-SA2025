:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Nisyros, a small Greek island in the southeastern Aegean Sea, is home to Greece's youngest active volcano, featuring a 3.8 km-wide caldera. The island's geological history spans 160,000 years, with its youngest formations dating back 15,000 years. A digital twinning project aims to revolutionize tourism and education by creating a virtual replica of the volcano, offering a real-time and immersive experience.
The initiative involves developing a 3D digital twin of the crater using photogrammetry to create a detailed and realistic model. Integrated with real-time sensor data, it will provide dynamic updates on conditions like temperature and gas emissions. Visitors can explore the volcano virtually, access historical and live data, and view 360-degree images. This interactive platform promotes sustainable tourism and education by offering tailored experiences for tourists, students, and educators.
The project highlights environmental impact and resilience while leveraging artificial intelligence and emerging digital environments to enhance realism. A comprehensive web platform will combine a 2D crater map with the 3D model. Icons on the map will provide access to detailed sensor data, fostering a deeper understanding of the volcano's dynamics. The backend of the application will manage the digital twin and communicate with the frontend through RESTful APIs.
This innovative approach not only enriches tourism but also emphasizes environmental awareness and sustainable practices, providing a cutting-edge digital exploration of Nisyros' volcanic heritage
