:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Shishaldin Volcano, Alaska, is a remote and frequently active basaltic stratovolcano that exhibits a range of eruption styles. Shishaldin's most recent eruptive period occurred between July and November 2023 and consisted of 13 explosive events with ash clouds reaching up to ~14 km altitudes. Given Shishaldin's remote location, TROPOMI satellite-derived SO~2~ emission measurements were a key parameter used by the Alaska Volcano Observatory to track volcanic activity during this eruption. Throughout most of the eruptive sequence, SO~2~ emissions were primarily associated with large explosions. However, during a 2-week period in October, SO~2~ plumes were detected daily in the absence of significant explosive activity as determined through seismic, infrasound and webcam observations. Based on gas compositions measured during a 2015 field campaign, and a Shishaldin-specific degassing model, we infer that substantial sulfur does not exsolve from Shishaldin's basaltic magma until depths of <3 km. This suggests that satellite SO~2~ observations can be used to track shallow magma ascent and degassing at Shishaldin. We use the cumulative SO~2~ mass emitted during the 2023 eruption (0.32 Mt) along with the melt S concentrations from the 1999 eruption (ΔS ~1500 ppm) to estimate a total dense rock equivalent volume of degassed magma of ~50 x 10^6^m^3^. Comparing this result with the 2023 deflation volume (~10 x 10^6^ m^3^), we estimate a ratio of eruptive to intrusive (degassed) magma of ~0.2. This case study highlights the utility of satellite SO~2~ data when combined with complementary datasets to inform eruptive processes, especially at remote volcanoes.
