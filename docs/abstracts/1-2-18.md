:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The Iceland Didactical Project 2024 is an educational initiative led by second-year Bachelor students, now third-year students, in Earth and Environmental Science from the University of Geneva, supported by their professors, research group members and the SciencEscape, a non-profit science outreach organization. This project focused on developing a data-driven approach to teaching by collecting petrological, geophysical, and surface deformation data on the 2021-2024 volcanic eruptions on the Reykjanes Peninsula (Iceland). In particular, wWe collected data during a multidisciplinary field campaign, from July 21^st^ to August 11^th^, 2024. In the following autumn semester, we analysed lava flow samples using optical microscopy, X-ray Fluorescence and Inductively Coupled Laser Ablation Mass Spectrometry to obtain whole rock, major, and trace element data. Additionally, we analysed minerals and matrix glasses using an Electron Probe Micro Analyzer to perform thermobarometry and chemometry. Finally, we collected diffusion profiles in olivine to retrieve information on pre-eruptive residence time for the different eruptions.  We used these data in combination with structural and petrological data from the field to provide insights on the evolution of the plumbing system feeding the eruptions in the Reykjanes Peninsula, to establish eventual links between magma erupted from different localities, and to formulate hypotheses on the factors controlling temporal variations of magma chemistry observed in the samples.
