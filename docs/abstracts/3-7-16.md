:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Saudi Arabia hosts 13 small-scale intraplate volcanic fields, the so-called Harrats, covering a total area of ~90,000km². They are distributed along the western margin of the country at varying distances from the Red Sea spreading axis and the Afar mantle plume[1]. Magmatism of the Harrats began at ~30Ma, contemporaneous with the initiation of the Red Sea rifting, and has continued until historical times, with the most recent eruption in 1256AD, next to the holy city of Medinah[2,3]. The origin and source of the Harrats have been debated and are attributed to two endmember processes: 1) Upwelling of hot asthenospheric mantle from the Afar plume[4,5]; 2) Decompression melting caused by Red Sea extension and thinning of the lithosphere[6,7]. However, most studies investigated samples covering a large range of ages and thus may not be representative for the most recent volcanism. In this study, we focus on the youngest volcanic phase (<10,000ky) to assess the current origins, sources and hazards. We present whole rock major and trace elements, and radiogenic isotope data, along with mineral chemistry of the youngest volcanic products collected from 9 different Harrats throughout the country, to clarify why and how volcanism persists in this tectonically complex region and to evaluate the associated hazards of these small-scale volcanic fields.
