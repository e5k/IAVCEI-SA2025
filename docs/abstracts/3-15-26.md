:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Volcán de Fuego, Guatemala, is a densely populated persistently active stratovolcano, with over 50,000 people living within 10 km of the crater. Recent activity has been characterised by low-level Strombolian to Vulcanian explosive activity, effusive phases, and paroxysmal eruptions. The volcano is monitored by INSIVUMEH using a network of seismic and acoustic instruments, web cameras, satellite observations, along with daily reports from three local observers. The greatest hazard is related to the frequent occurrence of pyroclastic flows during paroxysms, therefore it is crucial to understand the magma properties and pre- and syn-eruptive processes associated with these intense explosive events, as well as the background activity.
There is a notable dearth of published data on the rheology of the basaltic to basaltic andesite magmas erupted at Fuego -- the high level of volcanic activity and steep slopes represent significant barriers to sample collection. Here, we report the results of high-temperature deformation experiments on a suite of samples collected from the Las Lajas and Cenizas channels in August 2023. Although these samples cannot be tied to a precise eruption date, they are fresh in appearance, cover the range of crystallinity and vesicularity observed in the field, and are assumed to be reasonably representative of the recent range of activity at Fuego (i.e. approximately 5 years prior to collection). We discuss the rheology results in the context of crystal micro-textures and seismic monitoring data to gain insights into shallow volcanic processes and eruption dynamics at Fuego.
