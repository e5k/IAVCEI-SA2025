:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

This presentation introduces the technique of diffusion chronometry, highlighting the mineral phases to which the method can be applied and the volcanological insights it provides. It will include case studies spanning a wide range of timescales, from hours and days to years and centuries, demonstrating how diffusion chronometry has been used to reconstruct the timing of magmatic processes. The talk will also explore how this method can be integrated with volcano monitoring data to better understand the conditions and processes leading to eruptions. Finally, the presentation will feature DiffSim, an open-source software developed to estimate magmatic timescales using diffusion chronometry in olivine, orthopyroxene, and titanomagnetite.
