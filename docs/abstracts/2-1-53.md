Stromboli Volcano (Italy) is known for its persistent degassing and moderate summit explosions, with occasional powerful paroxysms. These sudden and intense explosive events represent the primary hazard associated with open-vent volcanoes.
This study investigates the geophysical activity at Stromboli during early July 2024, leading to the paroxysmal eruption on July 11. We integrate seismic, infrasound, and ground deformation data with visual observations and Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) imagery to characterize the precursory signals and eruption dynamics.
Our analysis reveals heightened volcanic tremor and Very Long Period (VLP) seismicity, accompanied by moderate explosions, lava effusion, and minor collapses at the North summit crater. On July 4 at 12:16 (UTC), a major explosion triggered collapse activity at the northern summit craters, lasting until July 7. Concurrently, effusive vents appeared along Sciara del Fuoco's northwest flank. The unrest climaxed with a sudden eruption on July 11 at 12:08 (UTC), preceded by a rapid ground deformation signal about 10 minutes earlier. This event generated a 5 km-high eruptive column and pyroclastic density currents descending Sciara del Fuoco.
We interpret the sequence as driven by the ascent and eruption of shallow-resident magma, followed by conduit drainage and the subsequent injection of gas-rich magma that triggered the July 11 explosion. The rapid inflation observed prior to the paroxysm highlights the critical role of gas accumulation and release within the volcanic conduit. This paroxysm aligns with previous explosive events at Stromboli, offering renewed insights into the precursory processes and eruption mechanisms specific to this volcano.
