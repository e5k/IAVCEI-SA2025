:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Volcanoes of Iceland have been studied using numerous remote sensing techniques applied by satellites, aircraft, and drones, resulting in ground deformation analysis, thermal infrared measurements, hyperspectral mapping, etc. Here, we present our results from the first-time application of a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) drone - Explorer RD350 - to study various volcanic landforms in different parts of Iceland. During our expeditions to Iceland in 2024, we collected SAR drone data over i) the areas affected by Sundhnúkur eruptions on Reykjaness Peninsula, including lava flows, crater row, and tectonic features, ii) the 1961 vents of Askja Caldera, iii) Hverir/Námaskarð geothermal area in North Iceland, and iv) rock glaciers at Hekla volcano in South Iceland. Explorer RD350 makes simultaneous acquisitions in three bands (C, L, and P) and operates in three modes (linear, circular, and helical). We used linear flights to obtain high-resolution amplitude images to visually interpret surface features and helical flights to obtain information about subsurface features via the SAR tomography technique. The SAR data acquisitions were accompanied by optical drone surveys (visible and infrared), which let us compare topographic features and thermal anomalies with surface and subsurface features identified in the SAR drone amplitude images. Along with numerous other results, we revealed that the higher intensity areas in the tomographic images of a Sundhnúkur vent likely correspond to higher-density material and represent the conduit of the vent. Additionally, we investigate other potential uses of the SAR drone in volcanology, including rock alteration analysis at certain depths.
