:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The North Atlantic Volcanic Hazard Partnership (NAVHP) was established during the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, to provide a coordinated approach to operational response to volcanic unrest and eruptions in the North Atlantic, specifically in Iceland and Jan Mayen. The partnership is underpinned by a Memorandum of Understanding between the Icelandic Meteorological Office, the Met Office UK, the UK National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the British Geological Survey. The primary objectives of the partnership are to: a) enhance capabilities for the monitoring, measurement and modelling of pre-eruptive and eruptive activity in Iceland and Jan Mayen and resultant characteristics of eruptive plumes and volcanic clouds and b) to facilitate provision of coordinated volcanic hazard related science advice and services to domestic and international stakeholders in civil protection, aviation, media and other sectors.
Since 2010, the partnership has met twice yearly. During these meetings, the Iceland Meteorological Office provides an update on Icelandic volcanic activity, with each partner then providing progress reports on their respective capabilities for volcanic and eruptive plume monitoring, modelling and underpinning science. The partnership also undertakes joint activities to advance capabilities, for example, exercises designed to simulate information exchange and modelling in real-time during eruptive activity.
During our 2024 Autumn meeting, we reflected on progress in tool development for monitoring and responding to volcanic eruptions undertaken in Iceland and the changing communication requirements between volcano observatories and volcanic ash advisory centers related to the production of new quantitative hazard products. This presentation will summarise these developments and changes.
