The present study aims to identify the conditions that led to the formation of the Late Miocene basaltic-andesitic ignimbrites at the Verkhneavachinskaya Caldera (VC), which extends over significant areas (120 km^3^, 10x12 km) on the Eastern Volcanic Belt, Kamchatka. New oxygen and hydrogen isotope data indicate that the intracaldera ignimbrites have low δ^18^O values, reaching -5.03‰ and - 182‰ δD values. The results obtained imply the presence of a substantial meteoric-hydrothermal system during the cooling of intracaldera pyroclastic flows in the presence of glacial meltwater, which subsequently led to the formation of the ignimbrite sequences of the VC. A comparison of Sr-Nd isotopes indicates the dominance of crustal evolution of the material, while Pb isotope systems suggest a significant contribution from slab fluid. Multi-isotope measurements allowed correlations to be revealed and the role of the meteoric-hydrothermal system to be ascertained.The present study aims to indentify whether elevated Pb-Sr isotope values could be associated with the introduction of these elements by potential sources from the radiogenic Cretaceous basement of Kamchatka. This would suggest a predominant role for the meteoric-hydrothermal system in the evolution of the geochemical characteristics of the VC ignimbrites. Conversely, variations in ^143^Nd/^144^Nd and their negative correlation with ^87^Sr/^86^Sr suggest a predominantly magmatic origin for at least some of the observed trends.The observed trend of δ^11^B with correlation to Nd isotopes suggests a substantial contribution of slab input to the magma explosivity of the VC.
