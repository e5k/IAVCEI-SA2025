:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Volcanic activity has many facets and although we all have a predefined image of how a volcano looks like, Earth and other planets in our Solar system feature unexpected and special volcanic structures. Our outreach activity will engage the public in seeing beyond what they know about volcanic features. We will use a series of images such as pancake structures on Venus, black smokers on Earth, colorful lava flows from Io... to illustrate the beauty and variety of volcanic activity in our solar system. We aim to spark interest, reflection, and trigger questions and discussions about how one entity- a volcano- can have so many natural expressions. We will then ask participants to draw on a large fresco their vision of an extra-terrestrial volcano. The fresco will be put on display the last day of the conference.
