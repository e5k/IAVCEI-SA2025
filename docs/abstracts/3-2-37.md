:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

 Nanoscale crystals, or 'nanolites', are becoming increasingly recognised in natural volcanic clasts and experimental run-products, spanning a wide range of magma compositions and explosivity. Nanolite crystallisation can increase magma viscosity, through the rheological impact of the nanoparticle suspension, by increasing melt polymerisation, inducing chemical and structural changes in the residual melt and facilitating heterogeneous bubble nucleation. Furthermore, due to their large surface area, nanolites may be prone to agglomeration, increasing their impact on magma rheology. However, their morphology, spatial distribution and interaction have yet to be investigated using a three-dimensional (3D) approach.  Here we present an innovative 3D reconstruction and visualisation of nanolites in basaltic volcanic scoriae, acquired using X-ray ptychography, an X-ray microscopy technique with nanoscale resolution. Our 3D images illustrate that Ti-magnetite nanolites agglomerate in basaltic magmas. Their agglomeration entraps interstitial melt, increasing their effective volume and their impact on magma viscosity. We support our 3D nanoscale observations with images acquired using SEM and STEM, utilising multi-scale imaging methods to visualise nanolite crystallisation in basaltic magmas. We use our data in viscosity models to evaluate their impact on magma rheology, finding that the rheological changes associated with their crystallisation may promote magma fragmentation during ascent. Our results not only provide insight into the rheology of nanoparticle suspensions, but also the driving mechanisms of highly explosive, Plinian activity at basaltic volcanic systems.
