:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Explosive volcanic eruptions deliver diverse tephra to the background sedimentary systems triggering environmental effects along a time span ranging from hours to millennia. Advances in understanding volcaniclastic processes have occurred from different scientific perspectives related to direct observations of volcanic eruptions and the analysis of ancient volcanic successions. As a result, volcaniclastic stratigraphy dealt with short- to long-term (hs to Kyrs) overlapping volcanic signals resulting from different eruptive parameters (composition, magnitude, and frequency) and syn- to post- and inter-eruptive Earth System responses.
Through volcanological and sedimentological architectural and facies analysis of a Miocene explosive eruptive record preserved in the North Patagonian retro-arc, we develop a high-resolution stratigraphic scheme that hierarchizes short- to long-term arc-derived volcaniclastic processes and reveals different volcanic signals of one of the most relevant episodes of the Patagonian Andean Arc history.
The volcaniclastic assemblage allows us to interpret two depositional volcaniclastic alluvial systems related to syn- and inter-eruptive periods (yrs to Kyrs) of an arc-derived explosive eruptive epoch (Ma to Ky) that occurred within the North Patagonian Andes in Miocene times. Pyroclastic units represent short-term explosive volcanic signals related to arc-derived explosive volcanic eruptions with different magnitudes and frequencies. Secondary volcaniclastic units of syn-  to post- and inter-eruptive deposits of the volcaniclastic alluvial succession reflect short- to long-term environmental effects modulated by climate and tectonic topography.
