:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

In the late 1990s, the USGS developed a series of illustrations that have since become widely used by both volcano hazard practitioners and academics to discuss the spectrum of volcanic hazards and monitoring techniques. Building on this legacy, we present two open-source posters created in collaboration with RocksonpaperÂ®, a geoscientist and artist, to modernize and expand these educational tools. The first poster highlights the range of volcanic hazards and state-of-the-art monitoring methods, while the second illustrates the diversity of volcanic eruption styles and the corresponding volcaniclastic deposits they produce. The visually engaging and scientifically accurate artwork is designed to benefit a wide audience, including the general public, students, and hazard practitioners, by fostering a deeper understanding of volcanic processes, primary and secondary hazards, and current monitoring strategies. A key addition in this project is the explicit inclusion of often-overlooked phreatic/hydrothermal and phreatomagmatic/hydrovolcanic processes, which are critical to hazard assessment. We aim to produce multiple language versions of these posters to maximize their global reach and practical utility, ensuring that scientists, volcano hazard practitioners, and the general public worldwide can access and benefit from this resource.
