Glass chemical microanalyses done on 22 (crypto-)tephra layers sampled along a Black Sea sediment core by Cullen et al. (2014) indicate that most of these volcanic ash deposits were sourced by the Central Anatolian Volcanic Province (CAVP). New trace elements microanalyses confirmed the presence of Karagüllü tephra from Erciyes (~11.2 cal ka BP; Sunyé-Puchol et al., 2024), and Güneydag and Korudag tephras from Acigöl caldera eruptions (~21 and 27 ka respectively; Schmitt et al., 2011). Compositionally, it looks like one or two tephras came from Hasandağ volcano (e.g., produced from some of the younger than 60 ka Block-and-ash flow eruptions; Friedrichs et al., 2020), meanwhile all the other crypto-tephras seem to be sourced by Erciyes volcano (up to 11 more, and all older than Karagüllü). These preliminary tephrochronologic correlations would considerably extend the current known volcanic record of Erciyes (i.e., the Holocene Karagüllü, Perikartin, and Dikkartin eruptions, and the upper Pleistocene eruptions of Hacilar ignimbrite and KDR fallout; Friedrichs et al., 2020). This study has been funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (PÜSKÜRÜM project, grant #101024337), with additional funding from the Add-Sapiexcellence initiative of Sapienza University of Rome (BLACORTEPHRA project, grant #1715/2024) and the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under TURVO project PID2023-147255NB-I00, supported by MCIU, AEI (10.13039/501100011033).
