:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Volcanoes come in different sizes, shapes, and types. Each of them tells a different story of construction and destruction, of erosion and time. Unravelling these stories is the main focus of an interdisciplinary research area called volcanic geomorphology, which, with the help of satellite images, digital elevation models, fieldwork, analogue experiments, and computer simulations, aims to contribute to understanding the nature of volcanic phenomena.
 
In this interactive workshop, we will explore the diversity of volcano shapes, some of the processes we can infer from them and some questions still waiting to be answered. 
 
Duration: 1 hour.
 
Language: English.
 
Requirements: screen or projector, tables.
