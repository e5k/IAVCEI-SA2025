:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Volcanic crater lakes are present at over 15% of Holocene volcanoes and account for ~15% of volcanic eruption-related fatalities, despite hosting only ~3.5% of recorded eruptions. Monitoring physical variations in these lakes is crucial for the early detection of volcanic resurgence. However, their hazardous, gas-rich, and corrosive environments make continuous ground-based monitoring impractical, leading to significant gaps, or complete lack, of data.
Thermal InfraRed (TIR) satellite data offer a risk-free alternative to monitor these systems. TIR-based radiative power measurements can reveal subtle variations in thermal outputs that anticipate rapidly escalating volcanic phenomena. Yet, traditional methods for estimating radiative power either target high-temperature features or underestimate outputs from low-to- moderate-temperature systems by up to ~90%.
We here present the results from applying the TIRVolcH algorithm to globally selected crater lakes and introduce the TIR-based Volcanic Radiative Power (VRP~TIR~). This novel method accurately quantifies radiative power for systems dominated by temperatures ≤600 K, using single-band TIR radiance (10.5--12 µm), with an uncertainty of ±35%.
VRP~TIR~ enables the detection of subtle variations in volcanic thermal activity, providing critical insights into baseline behaviour and transitions to unrest. Its global applicability and integration with targeted measurements and modelling make it a vital tool for hazard mitigation and advancing the understanding of volcanic lake processes. By improving the accuracy of radiative power retrievals, VRP~TIR~ supports the development of long-term global inventories of volcanic energy loss, offering a key contribution to multidisciplinary approaches for volcanic lake monitoring.
