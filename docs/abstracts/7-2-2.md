:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Volcanic ashfall events have historically disrupted nautical activities in Patagonia, causing significant damage to ships and ports. Despite the severity of these events, which have included extreme outcomes such as vessel capsizing, there has been a notable absence of guidance to assist nautical operators in responding to volcanic ashfall. This stands in sharp contrast to the extensive support available to other transport and critical infrastructure sectors.
Building on lessons learned from past eruptions, including those of Hudson (1991), Chaitén (2008), Cordón Caulle (2011-2012), and Calbuco (2015), we have closely collaborated with local stakeholders to address this gap and release the first version of the response poster, "Volcanic Ash: Advice for the Nautical Sector (Version #1)."
The poster offers actionable guidance for ship and port operators, with potential applicability to other navigable areas exposed to volcanic ashfall. It first outlines the hazards specific to water transport systems, including primary fallout and the long-term risk of ash remobilization, which can persist for decades after an eruption. It also summarizes the potential impacts of volcanic ash on critical components of port and vessel systems. Finally, the poster provides practical recommendations for preparation, response, and recovery before, during, and after an ashfall event.
The goal of this effort is not only to make this valuable tool available to stakeholders but also to share insights into its development process, highlight the innovative information it contains, and gather feedback from colleagues on crisis management experiences and cases of eruptions impacting ships, ports, and global navigation.
