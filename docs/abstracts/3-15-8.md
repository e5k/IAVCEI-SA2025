:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

In November 2021, unusual CO~2~ emissions were detected in the neighbourhoods of La Bombilla and Puerto Naos, located on the western flank of La Palma, about 5 km southwest of the 2021 Tajogaite eruption vents. To investigate the dynamics of volcanic CO~2~ emissions affecting both neighbourhoods, 27 high-resolution CO~2~ and stable isotope surveys were undertaken in Puerto Naos between 19 October 2022 and 22 February 2024 (~ 2,200 measurements), and 17 surveys in La Bombilla between 2 March 2023 and 22 February 2024 (~ 700 measurements). These surveys utilized a Delta Ray analyzer mounted on an electric vehicle, enabling mobile measurements at 140 cm above ground level. The Delta Ray is a cutting-edge mid-infrared isotope ratio infrared spectrometer (IRIS) that simultaneously measures δ^13^C and δ^18^O in CO~2~ with a precision of 0.05‰. 
In Puerto Naos, CO~2~ concentrations ranged from 420 to 4,500 ppm, while δ^13^C-CO~2~ values varied from -9.0 to -2.7 ‰ vs. VPDB. In La Bombilla, concentrations were slightly higher, ranging from 420 to 8,000 ppm, with δ^13^C-CO~2~ values between -8.1 and -0.7 ‰. Analysis revealed that higher CO~2~ concentrations in both areas were spatially associated with δ^13^C-CO~2~ values less depleted in ^13^C, indicative of a volcanic origin. These findings underscore the utility of stable isotope surveys in assessing the impact of volcanic degassing on air quality and identifying hazardous zones in populated areas.
