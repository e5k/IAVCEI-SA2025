Submarine volcanic eruptions represent significant risks to coastal populations, marine ecosystems, and global transportation networks. Despite these threats, the dynamics, recurrence, and spatial distribution of submarine explosive activity remain poorly understood. This is particularly critical in shallow marine environments, where interactions between magma and seawater can lead to highly explosive eruptions capable of generating tsunamis, pyroclastic flows, expansive pumice rafts, and widespread ash clouds.
We will present new high-resolution seismic reflection data that, combined with bathymetry and seabed imaging, allow us to examine the genesis of volcanic features at the Northern Reykjanes Ridge. The seismic profiles reveal volcanic edifices with low width-height ratios, stratified outward-dipping layers, and extensive volcaniclastic aprons. These features rest atop a glacially eroded unconformity, suggesting their formation during the Holocene. Our analysis indicates that many of these edifices formed through shallow explosive eruptions, with some breaching the sea surface to form transient islands documented in historical records.
By comparing the seismic images of these volcanic structures with submarine volcanoes from the Azores and Aegean regions, we define the seismic signature of three primary types of submarine volcanic eruptions: (1) deep-water explosive eruptions, (2) shallow-water explosive eruptions, and (3) Surtseyan eruptions. This classification provides a framework for recognizing eruption styles based on seismic characteristics that may be applicable globally. Our findings emphasize the potential risks of renewed volcanic activity along the Reykjanes Ridge, including tsunami generation, atmospheric ash dispersal, and the formation of floating pumice rafts.
