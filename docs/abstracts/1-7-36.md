:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The Carrán-Los Venados Distributed Volcanic Field (CLV), ranked 6^th^ in Chile's active volcano-specific risk, is the largest cluster of minor eruptive centers in the Southern Andes. Formed during the Pleistocene and is still active, the CLV comprises three main units: (1) the basal lavas, forming flows up to 14 km long that fill the Riñinahue and Nilahue valleys; (2) two medium-sized peripheral volcanoes, Los Guindos shield and Media Luna scoria cone, and (3) 72 minor eruptive centers (scoria cones and maars) aligned ENE-WSW, with strombolian and phreatomagmatic eruption styles.
This study examines three historical eruptions: the 1907 Riñinahue maar, a phreatomagmatic eruption that formed a pyroclastic ring, with a lava flow filling the crater, and a small pyroclastic cone; the 1955 Carrán maar, a phreatomagmatic eruption with an 8-10 km eruptive column and pyroclastic surges up to 3 km; and the 1979 Mirador strombolian eruption, which produced a scoria cone, fall-out deposits, and two lava flows. These eruptions produced basaltic to basaltic-andesitic rocks (51-55 wt% SiO~2~, 7-4 wt% MgO) with typical arc signatures and microporphyric textures, characterized by microphenocrysts of plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene, and oxides, showing disequilibrium textures (such as resorption sieve and reaction rims). Textures indicating complex histories are still under study.
Detailed mineral chemistry analyses reveal pre-eruptive conditions and, through comparison with the peripheral volcanoes and the basal lavas, suggest a magmatic storage level at ~12 km depth. These findings improve understanding of the CLV's plumbing system and behavior, contributing to enhanced hazard assessment for future eruptions.
