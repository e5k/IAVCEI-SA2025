:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Santorini Volcano belongs to the Christiana-Santorini-Kolumbo Volcanic Field (CSKVF), the southernmost volcanic field of the South Aegean Volcanic Arc. Known for its highly explosive volcanism and caldera-forming eruptions, Santorini's terrestrial volcanic deposits have been extensively studied, revealing activity from c. 650 ka to present.
While terrestrial records show that Santorini's volcanism evolved from predominantly  phreatomagmatic and effusive eruptions (650-360 ka) to more explosive activity including several Plinian and caldera forming events (360 -- 3.6 ka), only the last 200 kyr of volcanic activity are well constrained. The early history of the volcanic field, however, lacks a continuous eruption record.
Here, we present the revised tephrochronostratigraphy of Santorini Volcano using marine sediments from eight drill sites within the CSKVF drilled during IODP Expedition 398. Geochemical fingerprinting of the tephras enabled the identification of most of the known Plinian eruptions of young Santorini, as well as numerous "new" volcanic events related to interplinian phases. Furthermore, our results show that explosive volcanism occurred long before 360 ka. These findings highlight the importance of complementary (marine-terrestrial) studies to reveal the most complete eruption history of volcanic systems.
