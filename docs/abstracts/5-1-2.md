Still today very little is known about the extent of geothermal resources across the State of Hawaii, and the first project to characterize carbon storage in Hawaiian basalts is underway. This presentation will review the US Department of Energy funded Hawaii Play Fairway project, which took place from 2014-2020, produced the first statewide geothermal resource assessment since the 1980s, and culminated with slim-hole drilling of the deepest well off of Hawaii Island on the caldera rim of Lanai volcano. The presentation will also describe ongoing projects.by the Hawaii Groundwater and Geothermal Resources Center related to geothermal resource characterization, as well as a current project characterize downhole conditions in terms of carbon storage potential in the ~3.5 km deep Hawaii Scientific Drilling Project (HSDP) well in Hilo Hawaii.
