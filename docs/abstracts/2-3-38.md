The study of surface deformation linked to dyke intrusions in active volcanoes is essential for understanding volcanic unrest and enhancing early warning systems. We present an analysis of a large set of 3D numerical simulations carried out using GALES, a multi-physics finite element code, to model elastostatic deformation due to dyke intrusions beneath Mount Etna. These simulations incorporate real topography and heterogeneous rock properties, ensuring an accurate representation of the geological conditions at the volcano.
The simulations span a broad range of scenarios with varying intrusion depths, lengths, widths, and angles, aiming to provide insights into the relationship between magma dynamics and surface deformation. The resulting data will be used to explore key deformation characteristics, such as displacement patterns, strain distribution, and stress variations. These findings will contribute to a better understanding of the processes underlying volcanic unrest and may support the improvement of existing models for magma ascent and intrusion dynamics.
Preliminary analysis of the simulation results will help identify potential correlations between different intrusion parameters and surface deformation patterns. The work also aims to establish a robust framework for interpreting real-time data from monitoring networks, which will be useful for future efforts in volcanic crisis management.
