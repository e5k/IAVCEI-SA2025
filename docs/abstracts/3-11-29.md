:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

**Neogene to Quaternary magmatic activity in the Pannonian Basin (Eastern Central Europe) was preceded with the most voluminous silicic volcanic eruptions in Europe in the last 20 Myr. They resulted cumulatively in more than 4,000 km^3^ of tephra deposited during a period of major lithospheric extension. The timing of the largest eruptions has been determined using zircon U-Pb geochronology, indicating several eruptive phases between 18.1 Ma and 14.4 Ma, representative of an ignimbrite flare-up period, followed by further eruptions to the east between 13.1 Ma and 11.5 Ma. Volcanic glass, zircon and bulk rock geochemical data yield specific geochemical fingerprints for each eruption and suggest the development of different silicic magma types. Thus, these fingerprints can help to correlate eruptive products, even with scattered distal occurrences over large distances and in case of severe alteration. We compare and correlate the proximal and distal volcanoclastic beds occurring in Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Austria, Croatia, Italy and Romania. Based on coeval ages and similar zircon and glass trace element compositions, the largest eruptions occurred at 18.1, 17.3, 14.9, 14.4 and 13.1 Ma, eruptions which might possibly reach VEI 7-8 size. Furthermore, the presence of several hundred meters of continuous volcaniclastic deposits of the same age indicates these rocks were sourced from caldera-forming eruptions. Volcanic ash was deposited over 1,000 km away from the eruption centers and occasionally accumulated by local redeposition in subaqueous environment, indicating the scale of Miocene volcanism was far greater than previously thought.**
