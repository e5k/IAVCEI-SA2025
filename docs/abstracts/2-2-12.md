Monitoring volcanic activities at remote underwater volcanoes or volcanic islands is still challenging. We have applied an analysis of sulfur dioxide (SO~2~) flux using a satellite sensor to monitor recent eruptions at Fukutoku-Oka-no-Ba (FOB) and Nishinoshima volcanoes, Izu--Bonin arc. We used data from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor. We estimated an SO~2~ flux for these volcanoes based on a daily snapshot of the spatial distribution of SO~2~ column amounts taken by TROPOMI and wind speed from the weather model provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency. For the August 2021 eruption of FOB volcano, SO~2~ flux during the first sustained plume phase was more than 10,000 t d^--1^ and up to 75,000 t d^--1^. In the later Surtseyan explosion phase, SO~2~ flux decreased to less than 1,000 t d^--1^ and was sometimes below the detection limit (100 t d^--1^). For Nishinoshima volcano from August 2021 to December 2022, the daily SO~2~ flux during the non-eruptive period was 100--1,000 t d^--1^, often below the detection limit. The daily SO~2~ flux during the eruptions in August 2021 and September--October 2022 was more than 3,000 t d^--1^ and reached more than 10,000 t d^--1^, especially in October 2022. These results indicate that the satellite monitoring of SO~2~ flux using TROPOMI is an effective tool for eruptive activities at remote underwater volcanoes and volcanic islands.
