:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Paroxysmal activity at open vent volcanoes is a significant source of hazard as it occurs with limited and short term precursory activity and has a severe impact both on proximal and distal regions with tephra fallout and ash dispersion, respectively, disrupting ground and air traffic. Characterization of the eruptive dynamics can be carried out with a geophysical multidisciplinary approach comparing data from different sensors to provide fundamental details on the dynamics and the onset of these eruptions.
Etna is a type case for the study of this activity as it has paroxysmal eruptions from summit craters up to several times a year, and is currently monitored by several up to date geophysical networks. This study examines geophysical data (thermal, infrasonic, radar, seismic, strain) from the INGV-OE monitoring network of nine lava fountains that occurred at Etna volcano from the South-East Crater (SEC) between February 2021 and February 2022.
Based on the study of thermal signals and analyzing simultaneously the measurements of other different geophysical sensors, we identify different phases systematically preceding the climax and closing the paroxysms. Progressive multiple vent activation, increasing explosions frequency and intensity, mark the transition to the climactic phase, that generates ash-rich column of several km high and disperses tephra hundreds of km from the vent and can be interpreted as significant precursors of lava fountains. This approach is an important tool not only for understanding the Etna explosive dynamics but it can be also applicable to other volcanoes worldwide.
