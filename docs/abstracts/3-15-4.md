Volcanic dykes are critical pathways for magma, transporting it from deep reservoirs to the Earth's surface, where it fuels volcanic activity. Dyke propagation involves complex physical and chemical processes, including magma flow, rock fracturing, and the elastic deformation of surrounding material. Understanding magma transport within dykes is crucial for advancing knowledge of magma dynamics and the associated geochemical and geophysical signals, which are critical for forecasting volcanic activity and mitigating its impacts. Although direct observation of magma transport in natural settings is not possible, scaled analogue experiments provide a valuable tool for simulating these phenomena in a controlled environment. Several studies have employed laboratory experiments to investigate fluid flow and host rock deformation during dyke ascent, aiming to improve the recognition of monitoring signals that precede eruptions. In this study, we present a novel experimental setup that enables the simultaneous observation of magma flow and host material deformation. To simulate dyke intrusion, we inject fluids into translucent gelatin blocks and use Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) to track embedded tracer particles, providing velocity data for both the internal dyke flow and the deformation of the surrounding gelatin. This setup is applied to investigate two end-member scenarios of dyke propagation---buoyancy-driven and flux-driven---helping us understand how these dynamics may influence erupted products and generate geophysical signals recorded by volcano monitoring networks. This innovative approach has the potential to enhance our understanding of magma emplacement processes and offer a more detailed view of the physical mechanisms behind eruption-related signals.
