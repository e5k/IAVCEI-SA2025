The Saghro massif (eastern Anti-Atlas) exhibits several Ediacaran plutonic bodies, with diverse composition from mafic to felsic. Our investigation concerns the Igourdane granite, located in the eastern part of the Saghro massif in southern Morocco. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Igourdane granite pluton using petrographic, geochemical, along with facies analysis.
The Igourdane granite measures approximately 4 km in length and 1 km in width. It shows an elongated shape with a NW-SE orientation. It is bordered by the Oussilkane Charnokite to the south, east, and north, and by the Arharrhiz granite to the west, occasionally it is intruding the lower Ediacaran meta-sedimentary successions of the Saghro Group. The contact between the Saghro Group and the Igourdane granite, exposed to the east, it is characterized by metamorphosed meta-sedimentary formations, which display foliation with magmatic fluid injections. 
Petrographically, the Igourdane granite features a primary paragenesis dominated by anhedral quartz, K-feldspar, subhedral plagioclase, biotite, and clinopyroxene (CPX), with zircon and apatite as accessory minerals. Secondary minerals include sericite and chlorite. Associated features include aplite and pegmatite dykes (ENE-ESE, 40 cm to 3 m thick) and rare andesitic dykes (N-S, 20 cm to 1.5 m thick).
Geochemical EMPA analyses reveal plagioclase zoning and chemical variations in CPX, indicating magmatic differentiation driven by pressure and temperature changes during emplacement. These findings emphasize the Igourdane granite's significance in unraveling the tectono-magmatic complexity of late Ediacaran plutonism in the Saghro massif and its broader implications for the Anti-Atlas magmatic evolution.
