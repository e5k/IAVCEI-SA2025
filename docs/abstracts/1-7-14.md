:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

The monogenetic volcanoes of Vitafumo and Miliscola emplaced some of the oldest deposits of Phlegrean volcanism, cropping out along the SW border of Campi Flegrei caldera. The two edifices formed one shortly after the other as the products of explosive eruptions emplacing alternating fallout and pyroclastic density current deposits. The juvenile fractions from the two successions were sampled throughout the entire stratigraphic sequences (up to 130 and 50 m thick, respectively for Vitafumo and Miliscola), which allowed for a complete chemostratigraphic investigation. This offered a unique opportunity to reconstruct the architecture of the plumbing systems of ancient Phlegrean volcanoes, whose study is generally obscured by two caldera collapses, abundant cover by younger deposits and intense urbanisation. Vitafumo and Miliscola juvenile clasts appear remarkably crystal-poor, the older Vitafumo volcano being slightly crystal-richer and featuring microphenocrysts/microglomerocrysts of sanidine and plagioclase mainly, while Miliscola pumice clasts are aphyric and display a glassy groundmass with variable amounts of sanidine microlites. Compositions are trachytic and in line with the generally strongly evolved Campi Flegrei pre-caldera products, with Miliscola samples being slightly less evolved as indicated by lower SiO~2~, Rb, Zr and Nb and higher TiO~2~, Fe~2~O~3~tot, CaO, Sr, Ba and V. No chemostratigraphic trends are apparent throughout the two pyroclastic sequences. These preliminary results suggest that in both feeding systems magma accumulation had allowed for extensive differentiation (likely accompanied by volatile enrichment) and homogenisation, supporting the idea that reservoir growth processes prevailed during the period preceding the caldera-forming eruptions at Campi Flegrei.
