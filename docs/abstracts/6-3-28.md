:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

During Tajogaite eruption in 2021, anomalous CO~2~ degassing appeared affecting the neighborhoods of La Bombilla and Puerto Naos, both about 6 km southwestern from the volcanic vent. These urban areas, not directly damaged by lava flows, were included in the exclusion zone due to the strong volcanic-hydrothermal CO~2~ concentrations (>5-20%). CO~2~ is an invisible toxic gas, as well as asphyxiant gas, and may be lethal when it is present in concentrations > 14V%.  
During the post-eruptive period, several institutions deployed own gas networks to delimitate CO~2~ anomalies, but their number was insufficient (<100). The results of these studies and the appearance of dead fauna (insects, birds, lizards and small mammals) due to high CO~2~ concentrations and low O~2~ levels in the air has made it necessary to install more CO~2~ stations in real-time, in order to delimitate the CO~2~ anomalies where CO~2~ air concentration exceed that hazardous thresholds, and help the authorities decision-making of people's return to their homes and stores. 
The ALERTACO2 project, participated by IGN and INVOLCAN institutes, was financed by the Spanish Government with an amount of 3M€, and has the goal of installing around 1,200 sensors in real-time, sending the data to a 24-hour monitoring room. At the present time, 1294 sensors are installed (1,287 indoor and 7 outdoor), of which 147 are in La Bombilla and 1,133 in Puerto Naos and 7 moving stations and 7 outside these places. Thanks to ALERTACO2, many families have been able to return in safety conditions to their homes.
