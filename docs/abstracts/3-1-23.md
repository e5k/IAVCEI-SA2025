:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Tropical volcanic islands are often densely vegetated and feature steep, rugged terrains, which can complicate InSAR analysis as they are prone to coherence loss and atmospheric artifacts. Despite these challenges, **AMSTer** software (a fully automatized, incremental, multi-sensor InSAR processor) provides an effective solution for detecting subtle deformation in such environments by integrating multi-sensor data and offering high-resolution, long-term monitoring capabilities.
We processed InSAR time series with AMSTer over three volcanic targets: Soufrière de Guadeloupe, Karthala (Comoros), and Piton de la Fournaise (Réunion Island).
-   **Soufrière de Guadeloupe**: Using Sentinel-1 (S1) data from 2018 to     2024, we detected linear summit inflation and significant south     flank sliding, revealing subtle deformation dynamics on this     stratovolcano.
-   **Karthala**: By combining S1 and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) data, and     applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to remove seasonal     artifacts, we observed deformation linked to a low overpressure dike     intrusion in mid-2022. Despite significant crustal movement, the     intrusion failed to trigger an eruption, providing insight into the     complex volcanic processes in this region.
-   **Piton de la Fournaise**: Using ALOS-2 data, we tracked subtle     inter-eruptive deformation in 3D, to capture the dynamics of the     deeper magma reservoir between eruptions, with implications for     eruption forecasting and hazard assessment.
AMSTer's ability to process data from multiple satellite platforms (including Sentinel-1, CSK, ALOS-2, and others), along with its fully automated and incremental processing, makes it a powerful tool for overcoming the challenges of monitoring deformation on tropical volcanic islands.
