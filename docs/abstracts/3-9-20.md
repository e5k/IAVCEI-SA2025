:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Having been never directly observed, processes controlling eruption and emplacement of high-grade, densely welded ignimbrites still present many open questions. We focus here on the Lower Pleistocene rhyolitic "Kencherra Ignimbrite", an important marker bed within the volcanic stratigraphy of the Central Main Ethiopian Rift. The ignimbrite crops out along the eastern margin faults of the rift, covering a minimum area of 1000 km2 with a nearly constant thickness of 10-20 m. Internal stratigraphy is defined by a characteristic sequence of facies, with basal and top vitrophyres enclosing the main body of the ignimbrite. This presents a pervasive, sub-horizontal foliation defined by laterally discontinuous parting planes never showing clear rheomorphic deformation, and possibly results from progressive aggradation and strain from a sustained current. Microstructural data, microscopic observations, density measurements, rheological experimental data, geochemical and geochronological analyses were collected to shed new light on its peculiar emplacement processes. The analysis of strain indicators and the collected rheological data are used to discuss in detail the main mechanisms controlling the emplacement of the current and the shearing imparted by the overriding particulate flow. This ignimbrite represents an interesting and peculiar case to study the syn-eruptive sequence of agglutination, deposition and deformation which characterizes the emplacement of high-grade ignimbrite deposits.
