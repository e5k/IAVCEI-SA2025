:fontawesome-solid-book: **Abstract**

Since the volcanic eruption of 2002, most of the city of Goma has lacked electricity. The cause, the lava flows had damaged the poles of the national electricity company which carry current from Bukavu to Goma, via Rutshuru (around 200 km). The city, not having hydroelectric power stations, can thus take advantage of its biggest nightmare, the Nyiragongo volcano, and its related activities, more particularly the hydrothermal systems around the city, to produce clean electricity and be independent of neighboring regions. However, the full geothermal potential of the city is not yet known. Apart from the magma chamber of Nyiragongo reaching 1000°C and numerous thermal springs (around a hundred) with variable temperatures which can exceed 100°C on the surface around the city, Goma can also benefit from the heat produced by the magma chamber of the Nyamulagira volcano, the most active in Africa.
