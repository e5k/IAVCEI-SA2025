The Indigenous Volcanology Network invites all members and people interested in becoming members to a meeting held during the 2025 Scientific Assembly of IAVCEI. We propose the following objectives for this Network meeting: determine and elect a formal leadership structure; provide support and mentorship for new Indigenous volcanologists; initiate a framework of ethical considerations for engaging, researching, and working with Indigenous people in mutually beneficial manners; initiate and advance future formal exchanges, workshops, publications, and databases to extend the Indigenous voice in volcanology.
