**Abstract**

For the first time, the K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (µXANES) method has been used on melt inclusions composed of both silicate glass and carbonate phase.  This study describes microscale iron (Fe) and Sulfur (S) µXANES measurements on nepheline-hosted melt inclusions preserved in Hanang lavas. Hanang is a volcano in the southern part of the east branch of the East African Rift (North Tanzania Divergence) and represents volcanism at the early stage of continental break-up; characterized by CO~2~-alkaline-rich magmas and silicate-carbonate immiscibility process at crustal level. Silicate glasses from Hanang display relatively high Fe^3+^/ΣFe ratio (Fe^3+^/ΣFe=0.30) and very low S^6+^/ΣS ratio (S^6+^/ΣS=0.06). The discrepancy of the oxidation state measured from iron and sulfur suggests that the oxidation state is affected by post entrapment processes or by the immiscibility process with carbonate liquid. In our case, we suggest that S speciation decoupling is attributed to silicate-carbonate immiscibility, and as such, low S^6+^/ΣS does not provide primary redox conditions in this system.  The Fe^3+^/ΣFe in melt inclusions yields magma redox conditions (*f*O~2~) at around ∆FMQ+1.4 for phonolitic liquid corresponding of one of the most oxidizing conditions within the East African rift.
