**Abstract**

H~2~O has a fundamental impact on volcanic petrology and hazards, particularly in arc volcanoes. The proximity of many arc volcanoes to population centers (e.g., Pinatubo, Mount St. Helens) thus highlights the need for reliable proxies on pre-eruptive H~2~O concentrations.
Our goal is to establish a robust hygrometric proxy for dacitic magmas by experimentally determining the partitioning of H~2~O between plagioclase and dacite melt, which has so far been unreported. Plagioclase is well suited for this purpose due to its ubiquity in arc magmas, extended thermal stability, and lower H diffusivity relative to other silicate phases^1^.
We measured H~2~O concentrations of plagioclase and coexisting dacitic glass by SIMS in vapor-saturated experiments conducted on a Mount St. Helens dacitic composition. Experiments were performed in piston-cylinder devices^2,3^ at 900-1000 ºC, 400-1310 MPa, and fO~2~ conditions near the Re-ReO~2~ buffer.
Preliminary results from six experiments (An~43-60~) show 3.7-5.6 wt.% H~2~O^T^~glass~ and 94-137 µg/g H~2~O~plag~, resulting D^plag-glass^~H2O ~ in  between 2-3*10^-3^. Key trends include the positive correlation between H~2~O~plag~ and pressure, and a negative An#-D^plag-glass^~H2O~ correlation.
These findings pave the way for reconstructing long-term variations in pre-eruptive H~2~O concentrations by analyzing H~2~O contents in plagioclase in volcanic deposits, partially overcoming shortcomings of other proxies, such as melt inclusions, H contents in faster diffusing phases or plagioclase-melt hygrometry.
