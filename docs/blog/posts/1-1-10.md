**Abstract**

The explosive January 2022 Hunga eruption in Tonga injected unprecedented volumes of water into the upper atmosphere and generated widespread climatic impacts. However, it ejected anomalously little sulfur. We explain the missing sulfur with volatile budgets calculated from a unique set of timed volcanic ash samples through the eruption. We show that magma was stored in a weakly stratified reservoir at 2.1 to >5.6 km-depth. Magma rose from its initial sites in <2 minutes then fragmented and quenched at 400--1000 m below sea-level. Ash grains preserve micro-scale chemical mingling and show contrasts in content of fast-diffusing magmatic water. The 11-hr eruption released a total of 319 Tg of magmatic water, which is <10% of the amount convected into the plume by magmatic-volatilization of sea-water. Of the total 9.4 Tg sulfur output we show that >93% of it directly entered sea-water during eruption and fragmentation. Our results raise the concern that satellite SO~2~ monitoring may underestimate the magma output of eruptions driven by submarine explosivity. The low mass of sulfur erupted to the atmosphere likely renders submarine explosive eruptions nearly invisible in ice-core records, even though Hunga has had an obvious climate influence, which resulted from dispersion of other volcanic compounds. Volcano-climate risk may be higher than current estimates.
