Volcanic ash, produced by explosive volcanic eruptions, is the volcanic hazard with the greatest footprint, with a local through (for the largest eruptions) global reach. This workshop provides a forum for those with operational responsibilities during ash-producing events – State Volcano Observatories (SVOs) and Volcano Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC) – to engage with researchers working on volcanic ash, from reconstructing past eruptions to plume dynamics to ash characteristics to impacts. The aim is to build connections between the operational and research communities, and increase awareness of operational realities and emerging research. Early career researchers are warmly welcomed. This workshop is sponsored by the World Organization of Volcano Observatories, the World Meteorological Organization Advisory Group on Volcanic Science for Aviation Applications, and the IAVCEI Commission on Tephra Hazard Modelling.
