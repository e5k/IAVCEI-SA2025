The United States and its territories contain approximately 170 active volcanoes. The mission of the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Volcano Hazards Program is to enhance public safety and minimize social and economic disruption from volcanic unrest. This mission includes monitoring volcanic activity at the nation’s volcanoes and issuing early warning of hazardous activities that pose a threat to people, communities, and infrastructure. The National Volcano Early Warning System (NVEWS) was conceived to support this mission. As authorized in 2019 by the U.S. Congress, NVEWS aims to ensure monitoring capabilities are commensurate with risk. 

In this workshop, USGS staff will provide NVEWS updates about progress on core NVEWS components. We are also interested in feedback from other countries with similar national-level volcano monitoring program as well as from those engaged in volcano monitoring and other volcanic-risk-reduction activities.
