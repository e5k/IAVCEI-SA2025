We will train participants to use our new cloud-based cyber infrastructure for volcanology which enables users to run models of volcanic processes and utilize workflows that build on these models for data inversion, model inter-comparison and benchmarking, uncertainty quantification, and hazard forecasting. We welcome all model users and developers to come and work together to learn how to: 1) use existing codes and workflows, 2) bring new codes onto the platform, 3) connect them with existing utilities, and 4) write user-friendly workflows. Lava flow, tephra fallout, and PDC workflows will also be demonstrated.
