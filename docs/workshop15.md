Taking advantage of the IAVCEI Scientific Assembly being held in the home of international diplomacy, this in-person workshop will bring together key stakeholders in the global ‘Early Warnings For All’ effort, including the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR).

The workshop seeks to advance multi-disciplinary understanding and application of volcanic hazards, their impacts and early warning. Impacts from volcanic events span many scales and include flooding, poor air quality, building damage including collapse, aviation and wider transport disruption, fires, and reduced agriculture output, etc. resulting in loss of lives and economic hardship. At the upper end of the eruption scale, volcanic eruptions can also cause major climate impacts with catastrophic global consequences. Nonetheless, most active volcanoes are not adequately monitored and lack comprehensive risk assessment and emergency management plans.

We are planning for an appropriate mixture of volcanologists, representatives from international agencies, hazard service providers, and other interested parties and experts.
