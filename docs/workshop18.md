The deformation of volcanoes is one of the key precursors of eruptions: when magma accumulates or ascends towards the surface, stresses are induced, causing the crust to deform and fracture. This deformation signal can be recorded either by remote sensing data, such as those provided by remote sensing such as satellite radar (InSAR), or by in situ instruments such as GNSS. Analyzing these signals using models enables the characterization of the plumbing system and transport mechanisms, which is essential for improving the mitigation of volcanic hazards.

The proposed workshop will introduce a software tool called DefVolc, dedicated to the inverse modeling of displacement data, whether from InSAR or GNSS.  The displacement sources can include fractures (fluid-filled fractures or faults) or massive reservoirs.  DefVolc is based on 3D boundary element methods for elastic media combined with inversion algorithms, specifically near-neighborhood inversion techniques.  The software accounts for topographies as well as interactions between sources. Boundary conditions are stress changes. DefVolc consists of pre- and post-processors accessible through a user-friendly interface that can run on Linux PCs or Macs.  Inversions can be performed on demand using the University of Clermont-Auvergne’s clusters or the users’ own Linux clusters.  Staff from observatories, universities, or other research institutions are welcome to participate. Participants should bring their own computers for hands-on exercises.
