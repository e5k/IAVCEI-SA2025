Volcanic plumes are complex, transient, multiphase phenomena that are difficult to study in situ due to their unpredictability and destructive nature. Multi-disciplinary approaches incorporating field observations of natural plumes, satellite and remote sensing data, and detailed measurements from analogue and numerical experiments have provided crucial insights. An integrated approach combining these methods enhances our understanding of volcanic plumes and improves model accuracy and reliability.

This workshop will initiate a comprehensive benchmark exercise for volcanic plume models by integrating field observations, numerical simulations, and analogue experiments. The objectives include developing benchmark experimental and field observation results for model calibration, reviewing the state of the art in each discipline, identifying challenges, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and outlining future research directions. The structure features invited keynote presentations and round table discussions. Expected outcomes are the creation of benchmark test cases, enhanced collaboration, and a future research agenda.
