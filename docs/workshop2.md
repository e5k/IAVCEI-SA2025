Volcanology as a research community has enduring practice and interests in direct engagement with communities at risk. When this engagement is successful, it can directly result in can improve risk reduction. If not done well, it could result in harm to communities living with volcanic risk. 

We need critical reflection on this practice: how does this work translate into actions during unrest or eruptive crises? How can we measure or understand this influence? Are there lessons we can learn from community work in other hazard settings or contexts? This workshop will address this by: exploring ‘lessons learned’ across our community, considering the state of the art in community-related work particularly in adapting to climate-related risk and considering how we might further improve practice by integrating this learning into future projects.   Finally, we will conclude by creating a pathway for future initiatives that might help us to learn from one another.
