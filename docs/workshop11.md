**Topic**: We will bring together volcanologists from a variety of disciplines and regions to explore pathways for greater inclusivity and empowerment.  We will discuss key issues such as gender bias, career advancement, work-life balance, family and caretaking issues, leadership, access to research opportunities, and intersectional issues such those that impact LGBTQ+ and BIPOC communities.  Topics will be identified through a questionnaire disseminated prior to the round table. This round table and discussion will serve as a platform for dialogue, collaboration, and actionable solutions, driving positive change in our community. We invite all interested members of all regions and genders to join this vital conversation.identified through a questionnaire disseminated prior to the round table.
